This isn't about perfect companiesâ€”it's about avoiding the worst actors and supporting businesses that align with our values.</p>\n            \n            <h3>How We Developed These Criteria</h3>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>Research-Based:</strong> Built on academic research, industry reports, and stakeholder feedback</li>\n                <li><strong>Client-Informed:</strong> Refined based on conversations with hundreds of ethical investors</li>\n                <li><strong>Continuously Updated:</strong> Regularly revised as new information becomes available</li>\n                <li><strong>Transparent Process:</strong> Methodology and reasoning are fully documented</li>\n            </ul>\n            \n            <p>We exclude approximately 57% of S&P 500 companies based on these criteria, with 40% of our exclusions coming from proprietary research that identifies issues other rating agencies miss.</p>\n            ",
