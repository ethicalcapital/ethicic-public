    "body": "<p>Composting feels like magic.</p>\n\n<p>All it takes is a little bit of attention and intention to turn table scraps into rich, fertile soil. Wait long enough, and you literally get to see flowers blooming in stuff that would have been sent to a landfill.</p>\n\n<p>And through the process of caring for your pile, you get up close and personal with the microorganisms that make our planet habitable. They turn cardboard, carrot shavings, avocado skins, and whatever else you throw at them into a cornucopia of life.</p>\n\n<p>The human's job in all of this is simple: give them the time, space, and air they need.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's analogous to what I do here in a few ways. First and foremost, I'm responsible for the pile of assets clients have entrusted to me. I stir it up when it needs air, do my best to keep pests out, and pay attention to everything that happens inside of it. Because it’s my job to make sure it’ll be there in the best possible form when my clients need it.</p>\n\n<p>But the similarities don’t stop there. Here are a few more investment lessons from the compost pile:</p>\n\n<p>**It's a privilege**. The physical space that's required for a good compost setup is hard to attain for most people. As a lifelong New Yorker, perhaps I appreciate this better than most. I wasn't able to start until after my 32nd birthday because I had no outdoor space to call my own. Similarly, the raw materials required to build an investment portfolio are out of most people's reach because the key resource is money. And most people don't have a lot of it. That's why I designed this firm so that we could work with people who share my values regardless of how much they have available to invest.</p>\n\n<p>**Time is in charge**. There's no sense in trying to rush compost. I'm sure someone would be happy to sell you a high-end machine that speeds things along, but that isn't needed or necessary if you approach your pile with patience. The same thing is true with investing. There are all sorts of trading strategies that people use to try and accelerate things, but the result often unnatural, costly, and worse than the returns that accrue to patient investors.</p>\n\n<p>**Balance is everything**. Most compost piles feature a roughly three pounds of \"browns\" like shredded cardboard or dead leaves for every pound of \"greens\" like table scraps and plant cuttings. The balance ensures that the microorganisms in the pile have the correct amounts of carbon for energy and nitrogen for protein production. Similarly, portfolios should balance out investments in higher-risk innovative companies with allocations to more established enterprises and sustainable real estate to ensure we have enough stability to weather whatever may happen in the market.</p>\n\n<p>**Diligence matters**. Anything that makes it into your compost pile may eventually wind up in your food. So it's important to make sure that the plastic wrappers, cigarette butts, and other miscellaneous waste that often materializes outdoors (at least here in Brooklyn) get dealt with safely. I run all of the soil through a variety of screens to make sure nothing bad makes it into my garden, and I do the same thing with the companies in our portfolio to ensure they reflect the values of our clients and their communities in addition to solid risk-adjusted return opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>**Nothing is wasted. **Even just having a compost pile changes the way a garden works. Plants that don't make it get reconstituted into the rich, black earth that feeds the next generation. It's the same way with investing, where we're able to learn something from every opportunity we analyze, even if we only wind up investing in a handful of them.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that's been an enjoyable exploration of some commonalities between tending a garden and taking care of an investment portfolio! If this has piqued your curiosity, you might be interested to learn more about our strategies.</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in learning more about composting, here are a few great places to start:</p>\n\n<p>The Rodale Institute has conducted pioneering research into organic agriculture</p>\n\n<p>r/composting is an active community of fellow composters</p>\n\n<p>The Cornell Waste Management Institute has great resources on composting from a variety of perspectives</p>",

Wally Davis and Chuck Posternak hired me as an intern at what\\u2019s now the <a href=\\\"https://www.oppenheimer.com/grandcentralpcg/\\\">Grand Central Private Client Group</a>. I was paid $15 an hour to build spreadsheets that described clients\\u2019 financial situations and our associated asset management positioning.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"9d5e2\\\">It ruled.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"d97b7\\\">I got to meet with fund managers, build models, and generally research stuff to my heart\\u2019s content. I also had unrestricted access to a Bloomberg terminal, which was one of the more exciting developments of my adolescence. But it wasn\\u2019t my first contact with markets. That came much earlier thanks to my parents, who were both enterprising in their careers and open with their experiences as I was growing up.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"71mgk\\\"><b>My mom liked to joke that she taught me the difference between debt and equity before I could ride a bike</b>. Which is more or less true. She and my dad had an imperfect marriage, but their shared interest in the capital markets gave them a source of conversation on long car rides. Mom eventually left her career at Lehman Brothers to teach AP economics at Stuyvesant High School (Forbes wrote <a href=\\\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0412/second-acts-clarissa-bushman-careers-teaching-book-value.html?sh=2d5ad05c2453\\\">a great piece</a> about that transition) so I guess it makes sense that I think of myself as her first student in addition to her first child. The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"bfnmi\\\">My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I\\u2019ve ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qqyYDmOfs\\\">first tv appearance about it</a> every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"2ugr7\\\">Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, <b>I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds</b>.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"a7n08\\\">This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"7pc8r\\\">An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad\\u2019s interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"39l7i\\\">And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"4oka2\\\">That\\u2019s what I call a win-win.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"accd5\\\">My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"77p3b\\\">Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"1o7d7\\\">I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization\\u2019s online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/\\\"><i>Enterprising Investor</i></a> (still the #1 investing blog in the world <a href=\\\"https://blog.feedspot.com/investment_blogs/\\\">according to Feedly</a>) and jumped in with both feet.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"eq773\\\">The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/02/27/what-is-the-difference-between-investing-and-speculation-2/\\\">difference between investing and speculation</a>, <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/09/11/getting-schooled-in-risk-the-lessons-of-poker/\\\">what poker teaches us about risk</a>, and the <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/02/12/betting-with-buffett-seven-lean-years-later/\\\">lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett</a> are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"7jtr4\\\">Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/10/28/enron-revisited-highlights-from-bear-stearns-research/\\\">what Enron can teach financial analysts</a>, <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/07/12/finding-faith-in-value-after-all-these-years/\\\">the role that faith plays in investment processes</a>, and whether ESG and sustainability <a href=\\\"https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2016/09/01/does-esg-boost-returns/\\\">could enhance investor returns</a>.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"9eb5o\\\">We did a lot of stuff I\\u2019m proud of.

    "body": "<p data-block-key=\"8uy9z\">I've been following the financial markets since I could perceive time.</p><p data-block-key=\"4ns9y\">I first got paid to do it at Oppenheimer &amp; Company when I was nineteen years old. Wally Davis and Chuck Posternak hired me as an intern at what's now the Grand Central Private Client Group. I was paid $15 an hour to build spreadsheets that described clients' financial situations and our associated asset management positioning.</p><p data-block-key=\"6eo5g\">It ruled.</p><p data-block-key=\"h3hp2\">I got to meet with fund managers, build models, and generally research stuff to my heart's content. I also had unrestricted access to a Bloomberg terminal, which was one of the more exciting developments of my adolescence. But it wasn't my first contact with markets. That came much earlier thanks to my parents, who were both enterprising in their careers and open with their experiences as I was growing up.</p><p data-block-key=\"6dglp\">My mom liked to joke that she taught me the difference between debt and equity before I could ride a bike. Which is more or less true. She and my dad had an imperfect marriage, but their shared interest in the capital markets gave them a source of conversation on long car rides. Mom eventually left her career at Lehman Brothers to teach AP economics at Stuyvesant High School (Forbes wrote a great piece about that transition) so I guess it makes sense that I think of myself as her first student in addition to her first child. The picture above is me playing with her briefcase shortly after I learned to walk.</p><p data-block-key=\"pstx6\">My dad is also one of the most insightful analysts I've ever met. While I was cutting my teeth at Oppenheimer in 2007, he was warning everyone who would listen about leverage in the financial system and pushing the investment community to re-evaluate companies like General Electric that had become addicted to financial engineering. I still watch his first tv appearance about it every once in a while as a reminder of how deeply the markets can misunderstand a company.</p><p data-block-key=\"flhi7\">Even with these fantastic firsthand experiences, I struggled to understand why individual investors should invest their money in anything but index funds.</p><p data-block-key=\"dv445\">This chart, which shows the total return of both General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 since dad first went on TV to talk about it, gives a good sense of why.</p><p data-block-key=\"hd0jm\">Returns for General Electric and the S&amp;P 500 Index since August 15th, 2009</p><p data-block-key=\"n1w2h\">An investor who decided to bet against GE after dad's interview aired would have had to incur significant cost, manage mechanical complexities, and wait close to a decade for the insight to deliver any benefit to them.</p><p data-block-key=\"e4dt2\">And in the meantime, a simple index fund investor would have compounded their capital faster and had more time to think about other things.</p><p data-block-key=\"mvvmf\">That's what I call a win-win.</p><p data-block-key=\"o20mj\">My confidence in this simple and straightforward approach only grew as I gained more information.</p><p data-block-key=\"5o3xl\">Joining CFA Institute in 2010 gave me an opportunity to dive deep into state of the art academic research that surrounds the practice of investment management in a context where my sole responsibility was to highlight tools, tactics, and technologies that investment professionals make better decisions on behalf of their clients.</p><p data-block-key=\"st4ek\">I started out writing educational materials, but quickly got sucked into the organization's online community-building efforts. I was put in charge of recruiting expert voices for what eventually became the Enterprising Investor (still the #1 investing blog in the world according to Feedly) and jumped in with both feet.</p><p data-block-key=\"mr1nt\">The task was to connect with the most thoughtful investors I could find and convince them to put their thoughts into writing on our platform. That led to some profoundly interesting work. Notable explorations of the difference between investing and speculation, what poker teaches us about risk, and the lessons from a famous bet with Warren Buffett are just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p data-block-key=\"ig4a4\">Eventually I got to add my own voice into the mix in addition to curating expert views. I wrote about what Enron can teach financial analysts, the role that faith plays in investment processes, and whether ESG and sustainability could enhance investor returns.</p><p data-block-key=\"djrqv\">We did a lot of stuff I'm proud of. I even wrote a book with my friend and mentor Jason Voss about how to come up with original investment ideas.</p><p data-block-key=\"ri1l0\">I still couldn't see why individual investors would invest in anything but an index fund.</p><p data-block-key=\"yezgm\">And then I came out.</p><p data-block-key=\"mikec\">It was 2017. I had been experiencing gender dysphoria for my whole life. And I finally felt able to do something about it besides distracting myself. I changed my name, my appearance, and my pronouns with the benefit of a supportive work environment, then prepared myself for whatever might happen when the rest of the world noticed.</p><p data-block-key=\"12pna\">*Yours truly in Institutional Investor back when it was still a paper magazine.

    "excerpt": "People are worried about inflation. Should you be one of them?",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>Inflation has been an obscure economic phenomenon for most of my life. There has been plenty of academic discussion, but it hasn't crossed over into mainstream economic and political discourse.</p>\n\n<p>Until recently.</p>\n\n<p>Pandemic-induced supply chain shocks have coupled with Russia's war of aggression and the associated volatility in world energy markets to put it front and center in \"kitchen table\" economic discussions.</p>\n\n<p>Which is a polite way of saying that people are worried about it.</p>\n\n<p>I can see why.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, analysts ignore inflation in energy and food prices (which are quite volatile) and focus on \"core inflation\" which is designed to measure the other stuff in our day to day life. Things like medical care, apparel, education, and services.</p>\n\n<p>As the chart below from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, those prices have spiked after almost two decades of stability.</p>\n\n<p>What does this mean?</p>\n\n<p>And more importantly, how can we expect it to manifest in the broader economy?</p>\n\n<p>There is no shortage of scary stories about the ravages of inflation. Countries like Zimbabwe, Argentina, and Turkey have been indelibly shaped by it for most of the period shown in the chart above. We've heard of people who make a habit of going to the grocery store first thing in the morning because prices increase every afternoon and princes made into paupers by the mass devaluation of currency.</p>\n\n<p>Is that what we have to look forward to?</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, I don't think so.</p>\n\n<p>And I think that the general discussion about inflation in our economy has obscured some basic questions of fairness that should be of interest to anyone with a progressive political bent. But I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. So let's clarify some terms before we dive into what we can reasonably expect in the future.</p>\n\n<p>## What is inflation?</p>\n\n<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines inflation as:</p>\n\n<p>A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.</p>\n\n<p>That's not so complex! Prices up, value of money down. But a declining value of money doesn't exactly create warm and fuzzy feelings in anyone's hearts. Instead, it tends to create panic, since most people aren't used to thinking of the dollars in their wallet as something that fluctuates in value.</p>\n\n<p>That's because unless you're sending money overseas, traveling, or making a big-ticket purchase from another country, fluctuations in the value of the dollar don't mean very much to you. They show up in the price of things you buy day-to-day, but generally speaking the fluctuations outside of food and energy prices are digested by the time they reach you that you barely perceive them.</p>\n\n<p>## How is inflation measured?</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, the benchmark measure of inflation is produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They've created a metric called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is designed to measure the prices that consumers pay for certain goods and services.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to underline that we're talking about consumers as a whole here, not you in particular. For instance, vegans have generally been insulated by recent rises in the price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs. So our personal experiences of inflation may be quite different from what's described in the CPI.</p>\n\n<p>That's doubly true for folks who live outside of big cities. The CPI is designed to measure price changes for urban consumers, and doesn't generally do a good job tracking the experiences of people in Rural America who often have lower incomes, greater day-to-day reliance on oil and gas, and labor markets that are slower to adjust for rising wages.</p>\n\n<p>## Is inflation good or bad?</p>\n\n<p>Inflation is just one component of our economic ecosystem, which makes it difficult to analyze in isolation. With that said, many economic commentators have not hesitated to characterize it as a scourge. That's because it reduces the value of certain assets, like cash held in bank accounts, in a way that's quite scary to seniors and other folks who live on fixed incomes.</p>\n\n<p>But it also creates jobs. It's not a coincidence that inflation is flaring up at the same time as the US unemployment rate is drawing closer to pre-pandemic levels. This relationship is so central to our economy that the US Federal Reserve's mandate is to promote both \"maximum employment\" and \"stable prices.\"</p>\n\n<p>This effectively acknowledges a direct link between the recent \"great resignation\" which has featured all sorts of employees leaving their jobs for better pay, more flexibility, or long-term career opportunities and the rise we've seen in inflation rates. One begets the other. So it would be quite difficult to issue an accurate blanket characterization of it as good or bad because at some level, it's both.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn't seem to stop people.</p>\n\n<p>There seems to be an army of right-wing zealots ready to pounce on every inflation-related datapoint in an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the long-term stability of our economy. In many cases, these pundits have been making the same case for years without regard to the evidence. And in my judgment, you would be well served by ignoring them. A well-diversified portfolio of stocks (such as the sort that we build for our clients) is widely seen as the best way to preserve the value of your wealth over long time horizons.</p>\n\n<p>## What's the relationship between debt and inflation?</p>\n\n<p>The mainstream discussion about inflation tends to overlook something crucial: many Americans are in significant amounts of debt. I'm talking less about mortgages here than credit cards, student loans, and medical debts that often come with high interest rates and target some of our poorest populations.</p>\n\n<p>This probably doesn't come as news, since at this point almost everyone has a friend or loved one that has been touched by this personally. A recent Liberty Street Economics analysis published by the New York Federal Reserve found that Black, Hispanic, and Female college graduates were much more likely than other graduates to still be carrying student loan debt at age thirty.</p>\n\n<p>This means that those graduates effectively had their earnings reduced by the cost of carrying their student loan debt. And because inflation reduces the cost of paying back those debts, its recent rise may wind up reducing the burden that these borrowers are set to bear in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it's nothing compared to just cancelling the loans outright or enacting broader-scale economic justice reforms. But we'll have to leave those topics for another time. Feel free to reach out to us if you don't feel like waiting, though.</p>\n\n<p>## What's the best way to protect my assets from inflation?</p>\n\n<p>Most well-diversified portfolios are designed to protect the value of your assets over time, but some do a better job of that than others. As a general rule, companies with strong pricing power are the best situated to navigate an extended inflationary environment. Investments in tangible assets, like real estate and infrastructure, should also be expected to hold up well.</p>\n\n<p>The strategies we manage here are designed with this in mind, and tend to hold larger-than-average concentrations of real estate and electric utilities. Our due diligence process also evaluates a company's degree of pricing power, which is a fancy way of saying that we take inflation extremely seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone concerned with inflation should also consider owning some I Bonds. Issued by the US Treasury, these are special savings bonds that automatically adjust their interest rates to account for inflation. That means that whether inflation rises or falls, you can rest assured that your I bond holdings will retain their purchasing power.</p>\n\n<p>The primary drawback with I Bonds is that you can only purchase $15,000 worth of them in each calendar year. They also withhold a few months of interest if you sell the bonds within five years of purchase, but the yields are so much better than most other savings products that they are still a compelling option for many use cases.

    "excerpt": "The food system creates more than just a massive carbon footprint: it leaves half the world's population exposed to risk of famine.",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>Today's supply chain snafus might be setting the stage for a broader, more complex catastrophe in the global food system. The availability of potash, phosphate, and fossil fuel derived agricultural inputs that we rely upon to feed earth's growing populations has already been materially reduced, and these stresses could take as long as 3-5 years to resolve.</p>\n\n<p>The timeline comes from to Peter Zeihan, an analyst I've been following for close to a decade for his sharp views on geopolitics, energy, and international trade. His YouTube channel is free, and has been illuminating during Russia's recent war of aggression, so I took the opportunity to dig a little deeper into how his views intersect with something that should be of interest to everyone on the planet: our food system.</p>\n\n<p>He would probably want me to underscore one point at the outset of this exploration: modern agriculture is an industrial process. It's true that regenerative approaches are growing in popularity, but at the moment only about 5.5 million of the United States' roughly 900 million acres of farmland is certified organic. That's well under one percent.</p>\n\n<p>So as a practical matter, synthetic fertilizers are currently supporting about half of the world's population.</p>\n\n<p>The chart above is stark enough before we pause to consider that supply chain disruptions (and the most acute threats to food security) are not evenly distributed around the world.</p>\n\n<p>North America is unique in that we have plentiful sources of potash, phosphate, and natural gas in close proximity to our midwestern \"breadbasket.\" Only a few other places in the world are so fortunate:</p>\n\n<p>Eighty percent of global potash production comes from Canada, China, Belarus, or Russia.</p>\n\n<p>China, Morocco, and the United States produce two thirds of the world's phosphate.</p>\n\n<p>Russia and the United States are the world's two largest producers of natural gas.</p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed that Russia featured twice in that list. Both Mr. Putin's Petrostate and allied Belarus are now subject to sanctions, which effectively takes a non-trivial portion of the market offline.</p>\n\n<p>It's too soon to tell what this will mean exactly, but just a few days ago the Interim Chief Executive of Nutrien, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, said \"We are going to run our plants. Run them flat out. Could we see interruptions in exports out of Russia? Yes. Can we see plant closures? We could.\"</p>\n\n<p>Such a disruption would be poorly timed, since the northern hemisphere's temperate agricultural regions will be in the full bloom of spring before too long. And fertilizer only works if you put it on the plants before they grow. So in the short term we're left hoping that these shipments can make it to their destinations.</p>\n\n<p>## The Food System is Unsustainable at Best</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it bears mentioning that none of this is remotely sustainable.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, potash, phosphate, and fossil fuels are not renewable. They need to be extracted, transported, refined, and then transported again to reach their final destinations.</p>\n\n<p>Upon arrival, they also have an unfortunate tendency to leach into groundwater and literally strangle waterways with out-of-control algal blooms. But even if those negative effects could be contained, farmers would still need to keep spending substantial sums re-applying these treatments every year. And their soil wouldn't be any better off after all of the expense and complexity involved.</p>\n\n<p>Farmers will do their best to adapt. Some might stop planting corn in favor of soy, which needs less fertilizer to grow than conventional cultivation methods. They might even take steps towards adopting regenerative practices by using manure in place of expensive fertilizers.</p>\n\n<p>But that won't help the folks in the global south who are already facing food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to pinpoint where on the planet these pressures will manifest, but one can safely and sadly assume that the darkest-tinted countries in the map above are set to carry most of the weight.</p>\n\n<p>This is a policy choice. And delaying our adaptation leaves many vulnerable populations around the world needlessly exposed to famine.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we were to forget how to make synthetic fertilizer, we could still adapt our agricultural system to feed everybody on earth and entirely mitigate the risk of famine by phasing out animal agriculture. This would free up 75-400% of the land currently in agricultural use (depending on the way you measure), substantially reduce humanity's carbon footprint, and prevent billions of living, thinking creatures from experiencing needless suffering.</p>\n\n<p>It would also create a much more resilient economy, since we wouldn't have to worry about geopolitical tensions spilling over into famine with the same sort of urgency. The expensive, complicated, and non-renewable inputs that are pushing us towards that extreme situation this time around would be replaced by manure and compost, which can be generated locally.</p>\n\n<p>## Can We Accelerate This Transition?</p>\n\n<p>We can sure try. But it will be a complex undertaking, and it's important to make sure that you've given yourself the space and support to take on this kind of challenge. True change starts from within, so this can be as simple as making an authentic commitment to try your best and follow any resulting instincts.</p>\n\n<p>If you do only that, I believe it can make a world of difference. After all, that's basically how I wound up starting this firm, which has allowed me to help others build financial security for themselves by aligning their capital with companies that are driving positive change in the world.</p>\n\n<p>A little more than 16% of our flagship investment strategy is invested in companies that are making our food system a little bit better and more resilient every day. They do this by:</p>\n\n<p>Making low-cost loans available to family farmers and sustainable electric cooperatives,</p>\n\n<p>Pursuing cutting-edge research into synthetic biology, and</p>\n\n<p>Providing early-stage capital to the next generation of agriculture and food-tech startups.</p>\n\n<p>It's very, very cool that we're able to make a professionally managed portfolio of companies like these available to almost anyone who can open an American brokerage account, regardless of how much money they have available to invest.</p>\n\n<p>But I hope to compound my firm's impact even further by sharing our thoughts openly and regularly through missives like this one. If you've enjoyed it, say so! I would love to hear from you.</p>",

    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>It is not straightforward to measure the performance of an investment strategy like ours.</p>\n\n<p>That's because:</p>\n\n<p>Our ethical criteria eliminates more than half of the companies that comprise popular indexes like the S&P 500 from consideration,</p>\n\n<p>“Sustainable” indices tend to concentrate their holdings in technology companies like Facebook, Tesla, and Google we also exclude on moral grounds, and</p>\n\n<p>We invest globally, which makes it difficult to compare our results with stock markets in any particular country.</p>\n\n<p>I could do a lot of complicated calculations to produce a more appropriate benchmark, but I don’t feel that would help you understand what’s happening in the portfolio any better. Instead, we will simply use the MSCI ACWI (a widely used global index) as our benchmark until a more straightforward approach emerges.</p>\n\n<p>In the chart that follows, our portfolio’s daily returns (purple) for the quarter that just ended are presented alongside the index (orange). These returns are net of fees, and though I feel it’s important to share them with you regularly and transparently, I have to stress that they tell you close to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>That’s because we are investing to build security and stability over the long term, not to produce a line that looks good on this chart over an arbitrary three month period. The pride and confidence that I have in our portfolio stems from the disciplined process that I followed to construct it and the deep research that has gone into each of its constituents.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it’s nice that we were up 4.03% in our first quarter. Most people agree that it’s better to be up than down. But it bears mentioning that we will lose money sometimes, because we invest in securities that fluctuate in value over the short term for reasons that are beyond mortal understanding.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn’t mean there’s no point in doing the research. The portfolio described below represents my best thinking on how to position ourselves for success and stability over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>## Thematic Overview and Positioning</p>\n\n<p>This section describes each of our current positions as well as their thematic role in the portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few quick notes on how it’s composed so that you can use it effectively:</p>\n\n<p>Holdings that have been added in this quarter are denoted with an asterisk(*).</p>\n\n<p>Companies are listed under each theme in roughly descending order of their weighting in the overall portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>This is not meant to change very often. We make concentrated investments in high-quality companies that we intend to hold for long periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are the companies that comprise our portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>## The Last Mile</p>\n\n<p>Everyone has a right to reliable power, data, and a safe place to live. But it will take building, installing, and maintaining an awful lot of things to deliver on that. These companies get it done predictably and sustainably, adding meaningful stability to our portfolio in the meantime.</p>\n\n<p>Our current holdings in this theme include:</p>\n\n<p>NextEra Energy, a regulated utility company and the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy (NEE).</p>\n\n<p>UMH Properties, a real estate investment trust that specializes in high quality manufactured home communities with substantial affordability and environmental advantages over competing housing stock (UMH).</p>\n\n<p>Armada Hoffler, an integrated construction and property management company specializing in mixed-use developments (AHH).</p>\n\n<p>American Tower, a real estate investment trust specializing in the installation and maintenance of more than 180,000 cellular towers around the world (AMT).</p>\n\n<p>Two skilled contractor businesses that are well situated to support the ongoing electrification of our domestic grid: IES (IESC) and Quanta Services (PWR).</p>\n\n<p>*Ørsted A/S, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind power which is majority-owned by the government of Denmark (DNNGY).</p>\n\n<p>TopBuild, which specializes in insulating homes from extreme temperatures and boosting energy efficiency (BLD).</p>\n\n<p>Overall, these holdings comprised roughly 30% of our portfolio as of January 2022.</p>\n\n<p>From an investment risk standpoint, they are characterized by long investment cycles, significant backlogs of work to be done, and relatively stable, predictable returns on invested capital.</p>\n\n<p>## The Circular Economy</p>\n\n<p>Our society needs to reimagine its approach to key resources. This includes reusing metals and minerals to avoid future extraction, avoiding excessive manufacturing, and managing whatever waste is created in the most eco-friendly way possible.</p>\n\n<p>Our holdings in this theme include:</p>\n\n<p>Copart, the world’s leading online marketplace for damaged cars which allows efficient re-use of resources at national scale (CPRT).</p>\n\n<p>Cintas, a leading provider of uniform and facility supply rentals for businesses of various sizes (CTAS).</p>\n\n<p>*Tomra, the Norwegian inventor of reverse vending machines and maker of innovative recycling sorting machines (TMRAY).</p>\n\n<p>Waste Management, one of North America’s leading recyclers and the largest provider of integrated waste services in the United States (WM).</p>\n\n<p>These holdings comprised roughly 14.3% of our portfolio as of January 2022.</p>\n\n<p>As providers of essential services to businesses, they benefit from increased operational stability, limited competition, and a significant ability to pass on costs that may manifest due to inflation.</p>\n\n<p>## Economic Plumbing</p>\n\n<p>Money makes things happen, and principled financial institutions play a significant role in ensuring that the right projects get funded and seen through to completion.</p>\n\n<p>Our holdings related to this theme include:</p>\n\n<p>Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, better known as Farmer Mac. This lender was created by Congress to support the development of rural America by supporting regional electric and agricultural cooperatives. It is our single largest position at 9.7% of the portfolio (AGM).</p>\n\n<p>Silicon Valley Bank, a leading commercial bank for high-tech companies and startups used by roughly half of the United States’ venture-backed tech and life sciences companies (SVB).</p>\n\n<p>Signature Bank, an entrepreneurial New York based lender seeing significant deposit growth thanks to the success of Signet, its digital payment platform based on the Ethereum blockchain (SBNY).</p>\n\n<p>HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector bank by assets. Known for astute credit underwriting and a range of innovative products, HDFC provides us an opportunity to support and benefit from the stunning growth of India’s domestic economy (HDB).</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these holdings comprise 18.6% of our portfolio as of January 2022.</p>\n\n<p>As lenders, these firms are exposed to trends in the overall economy. I expect them to experience some credit losses during recessions, but each of them has experienced management teams, a proven business model, and a differentiated growth strategy that should allow them to support inclusive economic growth in a variety of macroeconomic environments.</p>\n\n<p>## Humanity Rises</p>\n\n<p>Personal consumption spending is shifting towards companies that embrace our human needs and desires while adding comfort to our existence, which is meaningfully distinct from trend-driven models that tended to predominate before the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>Our holdings in this theme include:</p>\n\n<p>Crocs, perhaps the strongest brand that encourages people to “come as you are,” this company makes footwear that’s embraced by everyone from hypebeasts to dads who love to garden (CROX).</p>\n\n<p>E.L.F. Beauty, a leading cruelty-free beauty brand making products for “every eye, lip, and face,” the company enjoys excellent partnerships with a variety of retailers and growing international distribution for its affordable beauty products (ELF).</p>\n\n<p>*Nintendo, the legendary gaming innovator and creator of some of the least violent (and most fun) video game franchises on earth (NTDOY).</p>\n\n<p>Beauty Health Company, creators of the HydraFacial, an approachable skin treatment with material health and beauty outcomes, accelerating revenues, and a generational growth opportunity (SKIN).</p>\n\n<p>PLBY Group, famous for its bowtied bunny rabbit, today operates one of the world’s leading sexual wellness businesses and has made waves by embracing queer desire, entering the NFT marketplace, and launching a competitor to Onlyfans (PLBY).</p>\n\n<p>Cooper Companies, producers of contact lenses, hormone-free IUDs, and fertility products are building a diversified portfolio of personal care products that “improves lives, one person at a time” (COO).</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these businesses are 23.1% of our overall portfolio as of January 2022.</p>\n\n<p>These firms are exposed to vagaries in consumer demand, which can be difficult to forecast as it remains unclear to what extent “business as usual” will resume. But given that each of them is associated with strong brands and products that help people to feel comfortable in their bodies, it’s reasonable to expect them to gain strength in the transition to the future, whatever form it takes.</p>\n\n<p>## Entrepreneurial Imagination</p>\n\n<p>It’s always a good time to be an innovator, but now might be a better time than ever. These companies are commercializing advances in computing, material science, and biology to bring big things to market soon.</p>\n\n<p>Enphase, a market leader in microinverters that increase the efficiency of solar arrays in shady conditions and even enable continuous power production during outages without the need for batteries (ENPH).</p>\n\n<p>Alexandria Real Estate, a real estate investment trust that builds and manages research campuses close to urban environments and makes early-stage investments in innovative biotechnology companies (ARE).</p>\n\n<p>Ginkgo Bioworks, a specialist in genetically engineering organisms like yeast and bacteria for applications ranging from perfumes to vegan proteins and more sustainable agriculture (DNA).</p>\n\n<p>These positions comprise 13.9% of our overall portfolio as of January 2022.</p>\n\n<p>As technology-driven innovators, these companies encounter business risks associated with operating at the bleeding edge of human understanding. But they are far from unproven. All have enough cash on hand to weather a significant drawdown in the broader economy without being forced to raise capital at anything but advantageous terms.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Worries about recessions can seduce investors into making big mistakes. Don't fall for it!",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>We might be in the midst of a recession right now.</p>\n\n<p>I say that because measures of real-time economic activity have slumped significantly this year. As I write, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is forecasting that the United States' GDP fell by 2.1 percent.</p>\n\n<p>We can't know for sure if this will come to pass until the official data is released later this summer, but people are already worried about it. Google search volume for the word \"recession\" is already higher than it was in 2008, and the mainstream press is starting to write about slowing economic activity with some regularity.</p>\n\n<p>It's natural to wonder what this means. After all, most people assume that a recession is one of the most significant risks to their savings. There is certainly truth to that. The S&P 500 is down almost 20% so far this year, and it's likely that many investors have experienced similar declines in the value of their holdings.</p>\n\n<p>What happens next?</p>\n\n<p>No-one can say with certainty how the rest of the year will unfold. But this is a profound opportunity to learn from history because this isn't the first time that the US economy has slowed down. The National Bureau of Economic Research maintains a handy database of prior instances and we spent some time examining it for indications of how the future might unfold.</p>\n\n<p>One crucial thing to understand is that no-one rings a bell at the onset of a recession. They are generally only recognized in retrospect, when economists can confidently identify peaks and troughs in economic activity.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below is meant to illustrate one of the most important practical implications of this: by the time an official recession determination is announced, the recession is usually over. The grey bars indicate recessionary periods and the purple bars indicate when those recessions were announced.</p>\n\n<p>Buying stocks during the month a recession was announced generated an average return of 16.19% one year later.</p>\n\n<p>But much more importantly, remaining committed to one's long-term plan allowed investors to experience the profound growth that unfolded over the subsequent decades. Even terrifying periods like 2008's great recession were no match for patience and the power of compounding.</p>\n\n<p>Focus on what matters</p>\n\n<p>The real risk of a recession is that it will scare us into making suboptimal financial choices like staying away from the stock market, selling our existing holdings, and buying expensive \"protection\" from further market declines.</p>\n\n<p>These mistakes can be immensely seductive! I've got no doubt that there is someone making slick tiktok videos right now about complex trading strategies that purport to preserve the value of portfolios no matter what happens in the market. Your best bet is to ignore these, because they have a way of shifting focus away from what matters: your long-term investment objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Families, individuals, and institutions often forget that the simple act of centering these goals produces a profound sense of strategic clarity. In many cases, the money we manage is meant to meet goals that won't materialize for more than thirty years.</p>\n\n<p>That's roughly the entire amount of time shown in the chart above! It can be hard to picture yourself that far into the future, but it's worth a try. Because by then, you'll have almost no recollection of today's fears, just a sense of gratitude to your past self for sticking with the plan.</p>",

    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>The stock market is... complicated.</p>\n\n<p>But despite that, it is possible to construct useful understandings of how it behaves through careful study of its long-term performance.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get into that though, let's make sure we share a functional understanding of what we're talking about. Feel free to skip ahead if things get a little too basic for you, but we want to make sure that everyone's able to follow along.</p>\n\n<p>So let's start at the very beginning.</p>\n\n<p>## What is a stock?</p>\n\n<p>Happily, we have a euphonic case study that should help you understand this!</p>\n\n<p>Consider Crocs, the rubber clog company.</p>\n\n<p>At some point in their history, the founders realized that they needed more money in order to manufacture their products. This is a very common situation and can happen to any company whether it's small or large.</p>\n\n<p>Crocs' financial position is summarized by something called a balance sheet, which records all of its assets and liabilities at a given point in time. Assets are things they own, like ideas, resources, or physical inventory, while liabilities are best understood as the way those assets are paid for.</p>\n\n<p>As you might guess from the word \"balance,\" the general idea of these reports is that both sides should sum to the same value. The table below might be a helpful representation of this if you happen to be visually inclined.</p>\n\n<p>**Assets****Liabilities**Tangible (Equipment, inventory, etc)Borrowed money (mortgages, loans, bonds, etc)Intangible (Designs, copyrights, etc)Equity (often synonymous with \"stock\")</p>\n\n<p>Investors are best understood as providers of capital to companies. We have two primary ways of charging the company to use our money: lending it to them through a loan or a bond and investing alongside them as stockholders.</p>\n\n<p>## How are Stocks and Bonds Different?</p>\n\n<p>The main difference between them is that the return on stock investments is vague and uncertain while the returns that lenders like bond investors experience are generally determined (or at least well described) by a contract.</p>\n\n<p>If the company were to encounter financial hardship or - in an extreme (but illustrative) case - enter liquidation, bondholders would be significantly better protected from financial loss than their stockholder neighbors on the balance sheet. Bondholders generally receive the interest and principal payments they are owed before stockholders get anything in these sorts of adverse situations.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, if the fortunes of the business were to improve, a bondholder's best case would be to get paid back in full. By contrast, stockholders would participate directly and proportionally in the improving fortunes of the company.</p>\n\n<p>These stylized examples don't capture the full spectrum of how these securities interact, but they do convey a few things that are important for long-term investors to internalize:</p>\n\n<p>We can use both stocks and bonds to charge companies for the use of our money,</p>\n\n<p>Bonds have a predetemined payoff, and</p>\n\n<p>Stocks have an uncertain payoff.</p>\n\n<p>## How does a Stock Portfolio Typically Perform?</p>\n\n<p>This is where the fun really begins!</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, it is very difficult to forecast the future of any particular company with much precision. We may love our crocs (and be wearing them as we write this essay) but that doesn't mean we can see the company's future clearly.</p>\n\n<p>But when we combine individual stocks into a well-constructed portfolio, things get much easier to predict. Imagine that you purchased shares in the S&P 500 index, which is among the most widely used and studied indices, back in 1980. If you were to fall asleep for the next twenty years, you would probably have been very pleasantly surprised when you woke up and checked your brokerage statement.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a sense of how good that surprise would be, we've excerpted the chart below from an excellent review of risk management practices published by Sloane's former colleagues at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. This shows the market's returns on a logarithmic scale, which shows exponential growth much more clearly than the linear charts you might be more familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>You don't have to worry too much about those math words though: we've included this chart to convey that there is a clear pattern of gradual ascent in long-term stock returns. Just look how the line goes from bottom left to top right!</p>\n\n<p>*Source: CFA Institute Research Foundation, Managing Material Risk *</p>\n\n<p>So, if stock market returns are historically consistent, why is the stock market risky?</p>\n\n<p>One could easily write a PhD thesis on this topic, and many people have. It's complicated! But our goal in this essay is to leave you with a well-grounded understanding of how stocks behave, and it's possible to get there without resorting to pursuing a graduate degree.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the chart above, you can see that returns oscillated between flat and negative for more than a decade after the year 2000. The 1970s were similarly non-wonderful times to own stocks. These things have happened, and likely will happen again!</p>\n\n<p>But the important thing to remember is that they also usually stop happening eventually. And when they do, stocks' long-term tendency to appreciate has historically returned in force. So there are significant practical rewards to adopting a patient posture that embraces this reality.</p>\n\n<p>That's true in triplicate when you zoom in to consider what might happen in any given year. The chart below shows that the S&P 500 Index - the same one we examined above - has declined an average of 14.3% at some point in each of the last 43 years.</p>\n\n<p>Those declines are shown in red on the chart below, but they're only half of the story. The grey bars on the same chart show the returns for each full year. And despite some sort of decline occurring like clockwork every single year, the stock market managed to notch a positive performance almost three quarters of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Source: J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Guide to the Markets, Q2 2023</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it's probably beginning to make a lot of sense why stocks are usually seen of the cornerstone of a long-term investment portfolio: if you can ignore, indulge, or otherwise plan for their volatility, they have an extremely well-documented tendency to turn money into more money.</p>\n\n<p>We'll get back to bonds in a second, but before we go there, let's just lay out what we learned in this section:</p>\n\n<p>Stocks go down at some point every single year.</p>\n\n<p>They still managed to finish the year up about 75% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>To capture these returns, stay invested!</p>\n\n<p>But is this really all that different from the way bonds behave? After all, many people we talk to aren't particularly motivated by extracting every last iota of investment return from the market. They just want to live their lives with a reasonable sense that when they need money sometime in the future, there will be enough of it.</p>\n\n<p>## How do Stocks Compare to Bonds and Other Assets?</p>\n\n<p>The book Stocks for the Long Run by Wharton professor Jeremy J. Siegel is perhaps the most widely referenced study of long-term investment returns. It's worth a read for anyone serious about learning the craft of investing, but we bring it up here mostly because it also contains the excellent chart below.</p>\n\n<p>*Source: Wharton School Press, Stocks for the Long Run*</p>\n\n<p>This chart shows something remarkable in stark clarity: increasing our holding period decreases our range of outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Over the period Siegel studied - which begins in 1802 - stock performance was extremely variable in the short term. An investor who held a diversified stock portfolio for one year at any point during those centuries might have experienced a gain as large as 67%, a decline as stark as 39%, or anything in between those two values.</p>\n\n<p>But as we move our eyes across the chart to the right and examine a longer holding period, the difference between the best and worst return narrows significantly.</p>\n\n<p>After thirty years, the difference between the best and worst annualized return was only about 8%. So even if you were to pick the literal worst time in the past two centuries to put money into the stock market, there is a strong statistical argument that you would come out ahead with enough patience, planning, and preparedness.</p>\n\n<p>## Should I Expect Similar Returns from an Ethical Capital Portfolio?</p>\n\n<p>We hate to conclude a fact-laden exploration like this with uncertainty, but it bears mentioning that the way we invest is nothing if not unusual.</p>\n\n<p>We are proud of this, and it's not going to change.</p>\n\n<p>The people who are best suited to working with us are generally unsettled by the thought of investing in an index like the S&P 500, which contains (among other things) many prolific carbon emitters, weapons manufacturers, and organizers of industrial-scale animal slaughter.</p>\n\n<p>We'd rather be punched in the face than have any involvement with those activities.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, a lot of our time is spent trying to insulate the portfolios we manage from an ever-growing list of product and conduct-based issues. In our view, this is likely to mitigate risk and promote adherence to our process, which has remained remarkably consistent since Sloane founded this firm in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>But again, we do things differently around here. If the thought of your portfolio behaving differently from your neighbor's is scary to you, it's likely you will be better off working with a different firm. If that thought makes you queasy, it's probably worth evaluating our strategies or reaching out to our team.</p>",

And with each passing month, I became more and more concerned that these operations were introducing errors into our reported results.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't so relevant for our existing clients. They have always had access to accurate, up-to-date performance information calculated by Altruist, our custodian.</p>\n\n<p>But it's important to me (and our regulators) that prospective clients have access to accurate, timely information about our investment strategies. So as of today, I'm making a material change to the way we measure and present our investment performance.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that this change is only applicable to the performance we show publicly for each of our strategies. If you're a client, the most accurate performance information will always be available to you directly through the Altruist web portal or app.</p>\n\n<p>What's changing?</p>\n\n<p>Each of our strategy pages now shows the performance for an actual fee-paying account that has been invested in that strategy since its inception instead of a calculated value.</p>\n\n<p>Why are you making this change now?</p>\n\n<p>Our recent hire has allowed me to spend additional time auditing our internal processes. I identified a deficiency in our existing approach and moved to correct it.</p>\n\n<p>How significant is this change?</p>\n\n<p>It's significant. We are discontinuing the practice of reporting on our real estate strategy, and restating the historical performance of our other two strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The table below shows the cumulative performance of our Veda Ethical Growth strategy calculated under the new methodology and the old methodology from October 2021 through March 2023, when the old methodology was discontinued for this strategy. Both the new and old calculations include all applicable fees.</p>\n\n<p>**New Calculation****Old Calculation****Benchmark**-5.76%-6.09%-6.91%*Performance of the Veda Ethical Growth strategy from Oct 2021 to March 2023*</p>\n\n<p>The change also applies to the Veda Integral portfolio. Please note that this table covers a different time period than the one above. I've included returns from the benchmark in these periods in the hopes that it better calibrates your understanding.</p>\n\n<p>**New Calculation****Old Calculation****Benchmark**7.05%4.77%2.18%*Performance of the Veda Integral strategy from May 2022 to Jan 2023*</p>\n\n<p>I would not presume to decide whether this change is significant on your behalf. Instead, I've presented the old and new calculations for each month of each strategy at the end of this post. And like, created a whole blog post about it so that you can dig into the reasoning, examine the practical implications, and decide whether or not to move on with your life.</p>\n\n<p>Will the way investment performance is calculated change again?</p>\n\n<p>Over time, I hope to converge the approach we use with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) promulgated by CFA Institute. Attentive readers will remember that I used to work at that organization, and can probably imagine that I continue to hold its standards in high regard.</p>\n\n<p>If I see an opportunity for us to move towards compliance with these standards without compromising our ability to accept clients with no investment minimum, I will seize it. However, in the meantime I have attempted to strike a practical balance between complexity, accuracy, and timeliness.</p>\n\n<p>I've got questions about this. What should I do?</p>\n\n<p>Reach out to me directly!

    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>Many of our clients have significant charitable goals. This is a very heart-forward, mission-driven organization, so it makes a lot of sense that the people in our community are actively pushing positive change in multiple ways.</p>\n\n<p>We're not able to offer the same depth of insight on charitable donations as we are with investment management, but thought we ought to share some resources to make this process a little less mysterious. After all, if you're in the early stages of forming your giving plan, it can be downright intimidating to get started.</p>\n\n<p>Giving is best understood as a continuous practice, not a one-time check writing extravaganza. The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p>\n\n<p>Keep that in mind as you read through these resources, and remember that perfection is an unrealistic goal. With that said, incremental improvements in the way you approach charitable giving can compound into outrageous real-world impact over the course of a lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>To start, this comprehensive guide from Charities Aid Foundation highlights the three key considerations when embarking on your journey of charitable giving. It's followed by some excellent deeper-level articles like this one, which dives into measuring impact through evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping with the theme of general guides, this article also provides some insight into the key questions that donors will need to ponder over.</p>\n\n<p>The Washington Secretary of State published an informational page on navigating the many organizations you can donate to - there are several thought-provoking FAQs here, contemplating ideas such as what percentage of donations a charity should actually put toward it's cause.</p>\n\n<p>I personally love this piece from United Way because it discusses the notion of viewing your donation as an investment. They also offer several \"red flags\" to be wary of when vetting the organizations you give to.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of examining the plethora of organizations out there, Charity Watch is a hub full of resources for determining which groups are on the up-and-up (and which aren't). Here you can find a *ton *of information on specific charities A-Z. Give.org and Guidestar can also be used alongside Charity Watch to form a comprehensive analysis and source different charities.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've dialed in on the specific charities you're interested in giving to, you can also use Charity Watch to sharpen your general knowledge, as they also share interesting bits on things like why automated ratings are unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>In this piece, our very own Sloane discusses the parallels between business and finance and solving social problems with Mark Tercek, investment banker turned CEO of Nature Conservancy.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in a conversation between Sloane and Eric Friedman, CFA, we again learn about the importance of evidence in measuring impact. I found it absolutely fascinating (and relevant) how Eric drew comparisons between the amount of evidence present and the level of risk surrounding a giving opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>We truly hope you enjoy going through these materials, and that they provide some guidance in your journey.</p>\n\n<p>We're always delighted to speak with you, so if you'd like to further discuss this (or whatever else may be on your mind), please feel free to book some time.</p>",

    "body": "<p>If you ever stroll by my family's booth at the Elephant's Trunk Flea Market in New Milford, Connecticut, you'll be greeted by an uncommon sight for this day and age: several folding tables packed with rows and rows of antique dolls.</p>\n\n<p>Some are propped up individually on fragile wire stands, while others are set down and sprawled about in groups.</p>\n\n<p>Some are in mint condition, while others are far from whole (missing original eye(s), arm(s), hair, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>To most modern eyes, these once-treasured toys are nothing short of nightmare fuel.</p>\n\n<p>I mean:</p>\n\n<p>Open Mindedness is key.</p>\n\n<p>Doll \"rehabbers\" do exist, I'm sure a prosthetic could be engaged here.</p>\n\n<p>More to come later...but this piece is tagged a whopping $325.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the dolls also induce a strong sense of nostalgia for those who played with them in the past. And this means that there's a fairly strong cohort of collectors who find them irresistible.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not in this position by choice: my maternal grandparents were part of this passionate group, and when they left this world their amalgamation of oddities was bestowed upon my parents.</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are faced with the daunting task of sorting through it all and finding new homes for each item. We've moved three times to this day, and the stuff has come with us each time — not in the back of a moving truck, but in piecemeal trips made by my father and I.</p>\n\n<p>Though each doll does not need its own seatbelt, these trips have always been taken with preservation in mind.</p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how much we actually have, the entire inventory takes up about 2,000 square feet in the form of doll districts that proliferate in the garages, sheds, barns, nooks, and crannies of our life.</p>\n\n<p>\"Oops.\" - My face when I forget to upload monthly performance stats to our site.</p>\n\n<p>We do occasionally indulge in \"getting high on our own supply\" - scooping up an antique for our own personal use if it so happens to charm us. These acquisitions — alongside some free history lessons — are my favorite features of this strange business.</p>\n\n<p>## My First Contact with Markets and Valuation</p>\n\n<p>I was once a pre-teen tagalong while my parents who frequented these flea markets and doll shows. And back then, the pricing behind antiques was more or less a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that old was equivalent to expensive, so to me this stuff was essentially gold.</p>\n\n<p>I'd watch dolls, toys, and dollars exchange hands quicker than the cryptocoins were selling off when FTX collapsed.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to today: an environment in which making a sale is much more difficult, and as mentioned earlier, one where most folks will take a look at our wares, mumble something along the lines of \"ha, creepy\" and simply shuffle along to the next booth.</p>\n\n<p>In the event that we do find ourselves in a position to sell a doll, there's an obvious question: what's it worth?</p>\n\n<p>And it's tricky, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>Because dolls are not securities. They have no future cash flows for us to discount. They're just art, which means their value is strictly a function of what people are willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The preface to Expectations Investing — which Sloane put on my desk as part of my training — discusses how investing differs from art collecting:</p>\n\n<p>\"Why is one painting worth millions of dollars and another worth a few hundred?\" Bernstein asks. Even in a book as prescriptive as Expectations Investing, we learn that \"No calculations can answer that question; the owner merely hopes that another art collector will step up to justify today's selling price at some point in the future.\" So is it all just up in the air?</p>\n\n<p>Peter Bernstein, Preface to Expectations Investing, P.** **XII</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, an antique Bebe Jumeau French doll sits up for bid on eBay at just $31. Simultaneously, an antique Tete Jumeau French doll in better-off shape is priced at a whopping $5,400.</p>\n\n<p>That's quite a difference between the two, and I wonder if anyone will ever pay that $5,400.</p>\n\n<p>Though condition (i.e the extent to which a doll shows its age) is an important factor in valuation, and can often explain stark differences in price like the example above, there are several other considerations which should not be disregarded.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n\n<p>Scarcity,</p>\n\n<p>Provenance,</p>\n\n<p>Venue,</p>\n\n<p>Insurance or \"book\" value,</p>\n\n<p>And the collector profile.</p>\n\n<p>Careful study of these won't produce a formula for valuing dolls or any other antique for that matter.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, they offer an x-ray of my brain activity and the item-specific idiosyncrasies that are effectively summarized into the price of each doll.</p>\n\n<p>This shows how convoluted the valuation of anything can really be.</p>\n\n<p>I've been in plenty of situations where a \"top-tier\" doll, according to historical pricing and the framework I used, should have sold for exponentially higher than it actually did. These same considerations apply to any antique, and often influence the price of other assets (including stocks).</p>\n\n<p>Let's examine each of them in more detail.</p>\n\n<p>## Condition of the Antique</p>\n\n<p>Condition is a function of many factors: storage method, being played with or displayed throughout the years, original material, and of course, age.</p>\n\n<p>Storage method and original material sometimes go hand in hand: for example, a bisque doll like the French ones described earlier are best stored facedown if they have glass eyes. Fluorescent lights also turn dolls green, which obviously damages and devalues them.</p>\n\n<p>The original material can also create vast deviations in condition, value, and price.</p>\n\n<p>For example, French and German dolls of the early 1800s were made of papier-mâché. Untinted Bisque, a delicate and more adult-oriented material came about later, and tends to increase value today. These untinted pieces were made with the intention of being objets d'art, and can possess extraordinary details.</p>\n\n<p>Both materials are quite fragile and volatile, but unique in their own ways.</p>\n\n<p>Any doll from the 1800s, unless preserved by a line of meticulous folks who never took it out for a tea party would likely be in worse condition today than a 20th century reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, collectors prefer their pieces to be as close to mint condition as possible. The newer it looks, the more you can typically try to ask.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are always exceptions - one gentleman comes to our table looking for parts he can use in rehabbing disheveled dollies. We call him the \"arm guy\".</p>\n\n<p>This doll's chipped eyes either speak of all the fun it once had or the neglect it suffered. But they also bring its financial value down quite a bit.</p>\n\n<p>## Scarcity of the Antique</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the second easiest concept to understand is that of scarcity.</p>\n\n<p>There aren't many antique dolls which were produced with the intention of being \"rare\" today. However, a variety of factors can surround a doll with an authentic (or synthetic) sense of scarcity.</p>\n\n<p>The first step in establishing this is to identify the antique. There is usually a maker's mark or other identifiers on the tags if clothing is present. Once proper identification is accomplished, the internet is your most valuable resource in determining whether or not an antique is scarce.</p>\n\n<p>Some key questions you should ask yourself include:</p>\n\n<p>When was the last time a comparable doll was sold online? What price did it realize?</p>\n\n<p>Are there any other examples for sale today?</p>\n\n<p>Have I browsed/engaged with various forums and/or contacted my network to see if this is a sought-after or scarce piece?</p>\n\n<p>The list could go on and on, but hopefully these spark some ideas - at risk of seeming repetitive, this certainly isn't a science.</p>\n\n<p>## Provenance of the Antique</p>\n\n<p>The chronology of ownership, or provenance, of an item can offer great transparency into it's origin, authenticity, and even its scarcity.</p>\n\n<p>Isn't it interesting how the different considerations keep overlapping?</p>\n\n<p>A doll with a detailed, documented provenance will typically fetch a higher price than a doll without. However, like in any form of art, forgeries can and do exist. I've never come across a fake, but have heard stories of them existing (and fooling unsuspecting collectors).</p>\n\n<p>A counterfeit or fake is not to be confused with a reproduction, which was created to resemble its older counterpart but not fool anyone into thinking it is truly older.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, reproductions have somewhat \"flooded\" the market and had a negative impact on the value of true antiques. Folks have also knowingly and unknowingly passed off reproductions as originals.</p>\n\n<p>## Venue of the Antique</p>\n\n<p>There are an overwhelming amount of avenues where one can sell these, including flea markets, true \"doll shows\", eBay, and word of mouth. The last two are not concrete physical venues, but interestingly enough account for a large share of sales volume.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of venue and how it relates to valuation can be usefully simplified: one would likely have an easier time selling umbrellas at a sunny beach than on a ski slope.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be said in this business. Doll shows tend to garner higher demand than a standard flea market - which subsequently allows asking prices to come in higher at the former. But they come with higher costs for dealers like us, and offer no guarantee of a great day of sales.</p>\n\n<p>There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to venue, though, and we've been able to get rid of some high profile ($500+) dolls after meeting a dedicated collector through another client. High profile collectors will often show up at standard flea markets too.</p>\n\n<p>## Insurance/Book Value of the Antique</p>\n\n<p>The 16th Blue Book of Dolls (we actually lost our copy) is a prime example of a source that provides uniform guidance from a market expert(s) on insurance or \"book\" value.</p>\n\n<p>This metric can also be thought of as the \"replacement cost\" of a doll.</p>\n\n<p>However, in 2020, one reviewer said the Book was \"a little outdated for true values\". To further this point, another reviewer from 2013 said that \"Due to ongoing fluctuations in realized online auction prices, the Blue Book values are no longer firm, but still serve as general guides for comparative pricing.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is a great example of *very *outdated pricing. I'd feel like a grifter if I got $325 for a doll missing all of their limbs and outfit, and I'd be shocked if a piece like this could be sold for $100 in today's market.</p>\n\n<p>It's also important to emphasize again that the Blue Book (or any other similar source) can say one thing about price, but as art, value innately stems from what the next purchaser/collector is willing to pay.</p>\n\n<p>The key phrase here is \"realized price.\" Blue Book can only indicate value, not determine it.</p>\n\n<p>For what it's worth, this is also true of prices in the stock market. When we have our monthly rebalance meetings, Sloane often says that we must respect market movements, but also resist allowing them to define our understanding of a security's true value.</p>\n\n<p>## The Antique's Collector Profile</p>\n\n<p>The Collector Profile is my own concept that has had a profound impact on my valuation of dolls.</p>\n\n<p>You might be wondering why I haven't discussed the plain old concept of demand yet (which is super clever of you), and I'll explain why.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that in valuing dolls, demand is just one component that makes up the entire collector profile. It is an important consideration, but does not outweigh the concept as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Let us consider a \"perfect storm\" scenario: a collector plans to attend a show in advance, and they budget several thousand dollars for the show. They end up finding their \"grail\" doll, which also happens to be in mint condition - I'd have a tough time believing that the seller of this hypothetical antique wouldn't be able to fetch a relatively high price.</p>\n\n<p>But this collector profile would be a poor match if the same seller was looking to liquidate a box of spare arms and eyes. They'd be better off looking for a horror film prop director or creepy decoration aficionado. Or maybe even Arm Guy.</p>\n\n<p>While the collector profile applies to individuals, it applies to the doll-market on a broader scale: if a unique collector profile doesn't exist for the specific doll in question, that piece will NEVER attain its true maximum value.</p>\n\n<p>Further, someone with a desire to purchase it may never come along. It could sit in the Ahmed doll depot indefinitely, effectively worthless even to our cats.</p>\n\n<p>It's a very real concern in today's market, since nostalgic elders — the key drivers of past market activity — are starting to move on.</p>\n\n<p>Will a new pool of buyers ever come in and take their place?</p>\n\n<p>Some Final Thoughts</p>\n\n<p>Assets come in all shapes and sizes, and so do the considerations that affect their value. And if no one actually comes along with a desire to own the asset, does it have any worth at all?</p>\n\n<p>Over the coming years, I'm fairly certain that one of our clients will find themselves in possession of other obscure antiques. They might even be weird dolls, in which case this article will be particularly salient. If you find yourself in a position where you wish to sell them, I hope this series of considerations provides a starting point to do so.</p>\n\n<p>If not, I hope the \"x-ray of my brain when valuing a doll\" goes to demonstrate just how intricate the difference between price and value really is.</p>\n\n<p>As always, drop a line if you want to chat about dolls, stocks, or life! We love to hear from you.</p>",

    "excerpt": "ESG Investing has garnered dissapointment, cricitism, and even congressional investigations. What's behind all the dissatisfaction?",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing has gotten a lot of attention in recent years, as the promise of aligning portfolios with ethical values gained mainstream recognition.</p>\n\n<p>But it's long past time to wonder whether it deserves all the hype.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the promises of real-world impact, glossy brochures with pictures of solar panels on them, and a substantial weight of evidence indicating that these data can help mitigate financial risk if properly applied, the truth is that ESG investing often fails to deliver on its promises.</p>\n\n<p>To help our clients, their friends, and the broader world make sense of this, we decided to explore some of the limitations of ESG data and discuss why it falls short of what individual investors tend to expect from it.</p>\n\n<p>## The Illusion Created By ESG Ratings</p>\n\n<p>One of the troubling aspects of ESG investing is the high ratings given to extractive businesses that are known for their negative impact on the environment and society.</p>\n\n<p>Take Nestle, for example, a company that is almost synonymous with corporate greed to many of our clients and readers. Surprisingly, many ESG rating firms rate Nestle near-perfect, raising serious questions for me and many others about the validity and reliability of these ratings.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn't mean the whole practice is worthless. Investment professionals are supposed to act with independence and objectivity for good reason: there are countless examples throughout history of rating agencies failing to properly perform their duties. One of the most notable is extremely recent: the \"great recession\" of 2008-9 was in part precipitated by rating agencies issuing inflated assessments of low-quality mortgage assets.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, any investor worth entrusting your hard-earned dollars to ought to understand that it's unrealistic to wholly outsource investment decisionmaking to some scoring rubric or process.</p>\n\n<p>## The Inherent Limitations of ESG Data... and all Data for that Matter.</p>\n\n<p>Investment decision-making is fundamentally about making do with incomplete information.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we were able to use these data to create accurate assessments of corporate alignment with social good, other data gaps would inevitably emerge in a thorough analysis.</p>\n\n<p>At a certain level, there are just natural limits to what can be known.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a somewhat personal example: I'm a transgender woman. And even though we pick the management teams and companies that we invest in with extremely carefully, I still assume that at least one (and likely more) of the super-sustainable companies in our portfolio is led by someone who believes I shouldn't be allowed to use an indoor bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>That's largely why ESG data is geared towards anticipating and avoiding certain risks rather than driving impact or justice: financial risk is plain easier to estimate.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it: If a company depletes water sources near its production facility that it relies on to create its product, it naturally follows that the firm will either pay punitive fees to source the stuff or experience a production slowdown. Both of these circumstances would result in foreseeable declines in revenue that a forward-looking investment strategy might well be able to profit from.</p>\n\n<p>## Disaggregating Vague \"Build a Better World\" Value Propositions In ESG</p>\n\n<p>In a recent webinar, I shared a stylized hierarchy of value propositions for sustainable investing with the assembled group. If you'd like to access that full discussion just click the image below. But give it a gander in any case, because I want to tell you a few things about it.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, the premise of this chart is that the vague idea of \"aligning with a more sustainable future\" can be broken up into four parts:</p>\n\n<p>**Managing externalities**. This is the most basic reason that ESG (and the associated data) are important. Having access to information about the composition of a company's workforce, the carbon intensity of its operations, and the long-term planning processes it uses to prepare for a range of possible futures helps us know that their operations are not creating negative consequences for surrounding communities. Crucially, this can also help us gain confidence that the company is insulated from negative surprises, which goes a long way towards mitigating risk.</p>\n\n<p>**Aligning with growth trends. **Any version of \"building a better world\" includes building new tools, technologies, and infrastructure. And whether we're talking about safe housing for seniors, scaling renewable energy generation, or building better software for teachers, paying careful attention to what the world needs is a big help when designing investment portfolios. As analysts, we're able to work backwards from what's needed, identify large growth opportunities, and then ensure we own companies that are well-placed to meet those needs.</p>\n\n<p>**Avoiding stranded assets**. As climate change unfolds and humanity reacts to it, substantial disruptions in financial markets are all but certain to emerge. These will never be entirely avoidable, but they are somewhat forseeable. Take the case of fossil fuels, which will hopefully be substantially less widely used sometime in the next couple of decades. The financial think tank Carbon Tracker estimates that $1 trillion of oil and gas assets are at serious risk of becoming worthless as a result.</p>\n\n<p>**Driving real-world impact**. This is what most people think of when \"sustainable investing\" comes up. It's difficult to deliver and even more difficult to quantify, which has left many people with false understandings of what's possible. With that said, all of the strategies we manage seek to avoid preventable harm to living things while also contributing to positive real-world outcomes. With that said, we do our best to learn from the industry's past mistakes when discussing this with our clients, and will always seek to underpromise and over-deliver.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these four components of \"building a better world\" is worth thinking about in isolation, but as a practical matter it's worth remembering that we pursue them is all at once. There is a substantial difference between driving positive change in the real world and protecting your hard-earned dollars, but we pursue them all at the same time as part of an integrated process.</p>\n\n<p>## Reasonable Expectations: The Key to Satisfaction</p>\n\n<p>We focus on making sure that our clients have reasonable expectations about what to expect from the funds they entrust to us. That work is not just about the sustainability characteristics of the portfolios we design for them, but also:</p>\n\n<p>Helping current and prospective clients reach evidence-based understandings of what returns they should expect from their portfolios.</p>\n\n<p>Holding regular webinars dedicated to answering any question on the minds of our clients and broader community.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a disciplined approach to growth, which includes ensuring that our support resources are sophisticated enough to serve as a real-time resource for client issues.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, the attention we've paid to all of the holistic considerations above is meant to help you understand whether it makes sense to involve this firm in your life for the long-term. We think of ourselves as your purpose-built partner for long term investing, and would love the chance to demonstrate what that means.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Best intentions, board-level buy in, and a big budget aren't enough to do the kind of deep decarbonization work that's necessary. So what's a well-meaning manager to do?",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>I feel for the many corporate directors and executives that are trying to chart a credible path towards net zero.</p>\n\n<p>Best intentions, board-level buy in, and a big budget aren't enough to do the kind of deep decarbonization work that's necessary. And I'll eat a shoe if anyone can prove to me that all three of those conditions are present at even a plurality of corporations.</p>\n\n<p>So what's a well-meaning manager to do?</p>\n\n<p>In the conversations I've had with executives at the companies in our portfolio over the past year, I get the sense that there's a lack of useful guidance about what moving towards net zero actually looks like. As a practical matter, almost all of them probably assume that they need to start by hiring consultants to build a detailed estimate of their scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p>\n\n<p>And like, sure. That's a step.</p>\n\n<p>But it's the opposite of a functional understanding. Think about it: there's nothing wrong with hiring consultants, but it's a literal cry for help. And there are real limits to the contributions that third parties can make to something as central to long-term strategy as decarbonization.</p>\n\n<p>So I've decided to clarify how we understand the problem, the sorts of corporate actions that matter to us, and where we see the biggest opportunities for near-term progress.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're considering investing in one of our strategies, wondering how to get your company on the right path, or just hoping to get your hands around the problem, I hope you'll let us know how we can make this more useful to you by leaving a public comment or sending us a private note.</p>\n\n<p>## What Have You Learned Recently?</p>\n\n<p>The fifth National Climate Assessment that was recently delivered to congress estimates that extreme weather events already cost the United States $150 Billion each year. That figure doesn't account for loss of life, healthcare costs, damages to ecosystem services, or what's happening in the other 194 countries on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Our black, brown, and indigenous siblings will doubtless experience the worst of this. But I also expect the direct costs of climate change to permanently kill the vibes in more than a handful of boardrooms. Uneven, extreme, and unpredictable changes always seem to catch at least a handful of companies unprepared.</p>\n\n<p>The traditional corporate playbook has been to claim that such risks are well controlled.</p>\n\n<p>I categorically reject such claims. What I want instead (and consider to be table stakes) is a publicly available discussion of how a company has improved their understanding and control of these risks at least once a year for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite leaders already approach this conversation with humility, vulnerability, and candor. In the coming years, I hope they'll start to feel comfortable doing that in public.</p>\n\n<p>And I'll never need another Christmas present if they start to normalize practices like sharing new words they've learned, exposing things they've gotten wrong, and asking for help or insight from their stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>## What Capacity Can You Build in the Next Three Years?</p>\n\n<p>It might not be entirely clear how to go about capacity-building, so here are a few things leaders ought to contemplate charging their teams with in roughly ascending order of ambition, complexity, and career risk.</p>\n\n<p>## Source Carbon Removals1</p>\n\n<p>If you're still doing the spewing, it's time to get started undoing.</p>\n\n<p>The carbon removal market barely exists today, but every single one of the roughly 2,600 organizations with a science-based net zero target is wholly reliant on it to actually reach their net zero goal. Why? Because it's not particularly likely that any complex organization can truly reach zero carbon emissions by just decarbonizing their operations.</p>\n\n<p>What are Carbon Removals?</p>\n\n<p>Carbon Removals refer to processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere and demonstrably keep it from being re-emitted for extremely long periods of time.</p>\n\n<p>Yet only 32 companies with these commitments had actually bought carbon removals as of September 2023. And according to cdr.fyi, only about 120,000 tonnes of carbon removal have ever been delivered.</p>\n\n<p>If your company plans to eventually purchase carbon removals at some scale in order to meet your net zero goal, you should begin immediately. And if you do not plan to participate in the market, say so.</p>\n\n<p>Many corporate executives will feel that if they participate in this market, they will be expected to cover each and every ton of carbon they emit immediately. This can turn a well-intentioned climate plan into a weird spreadsheet game that's more about scoring arbitrary carbon points than manifesting impact.</p>\n\n<p>Save us all some trouble and skip that step for now.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, acknowledge that this is a multi-decade process that will require new internal sourcing capacity, supplier relationships, and strategic planning. Focus on quality over quantity, and remember that you're entering a new market that you will likely participate in for a long time. This is a rare circumstance where bravely taking baby steps will count as leadership.</p>\n\n<p>## Strengthen Industry Standards</p>\n\n<p>Evaluate any professional associations that may be relevant to your industry, and ask whether they're currently issuing guidance on how members should adapt to climate change.</p>\n\n<p>Is that guidance good enough? If not, why not?</p>\n\n<p>Remember that there is power in networks. In uncertain times, strengthening the soft infrastructure that surrounds you and your colleagues can be hugely clarifying.</p>\n\n<p>The intended goal isn't just to elevate the status of your own company but to influence industry standards on decarbonization as a whole. This can actually enrich the quality of your own strategy by sourcing incremental inputs from a larger professional network and decrease the career risk of climate action by building momentum and broader buy-in.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be possible and appropriate to create industry-facing resources that discuss your company's environmental processes, failures, and successes. In time, this could create a shared repository of knowledge that other companies can refer to when bolstering their own practices.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not suggesting you spill any trade secrets here. Take a page from the software industry, where it's common practice for engineering organizations to write about how they approach complex problems. In many cases, firms will even create open-source infrastructure that others can use to tackle these same issues. Do the folks thinking about decarbonizing your fleets feel like they can publish their analysis of the current trade-offs? If not, why not?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, take a long hard look at your lobbying activity. Are you advocating for stricter environmental regulations? I think you should be. This probably seems short-sighted, idealistic, and insane to some readers, but consider that it will also concretize the costs of credible climate action and build them into the cost projections of every major actor in your industry.</p>\n\n<p>## What Are Your Stakeholders Saying?</p>\n\n<p>Credible plans are intrinsically unique. Every business has its own ethos, targets, and constraints, and so should every climate action plan.</p>\n\n<p>Done right, this won't create conflict between your company's idiosyncratic approach and the reporting required by the folks who oversee the science-based targets initiative. Instead, it will help translate the long-term ambitions you've committed to into shorter-term steps and tangible decarbonization progress.</p>\n\n<p>Effective climate action will unfold in a dynamic process that responds to changes in technology, regulation, community needs, and your company's practical circumstances. Don't make the mistake of carving your approach in stone. Instead, celebrate what you've learned by sharing how and why your approach has evolved.</p>\n\n<p>I love it when managers directly cite stakeholder feedback as the root cause for these sorts of updates.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>It's straightforward: mainstream investors have been conditioned to care about ESG disclosures because they contain useful hints about whether a company is capable of considering and controlling risk holistically. The quality, diversity, and frequency of your stakeholder communications are the main mechanism that such considerations manifest through.</p>\n\n<p>So instead of spending all of your time on the outlook for next quarter or next year, think about ways to give us direct visibility into how you manage those relationships.</p>\n\n<p>It might be uncomfortable in the short term, but that's something we'll all have to get used to. Because even though there's material uncertainty in the path climate change will take, there is no reasonable projection that could be described as \"comfortable.\"</p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>",

    "body": "<p>Where are the returns coming from?</p>\n\n<p>If I teach you nothing else, remember that question. It's one of the most important things you can ask as an investor. And if you keep asking it until you're blue in the face, you're all but guaranteed to learn something.</p>\n\n<p>So let's look past our flagship strategy's handsome headline performance figure of 33.51% together.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below shows all of the companies that we owned at one point in 2023 and their contributions to overall performance. We've used their ticker symbols in place of their names to save space. Companies that we don't own anymore as of 1/1/2024 are denoted with an asterix (*).</p>\n\n<p>One more note before we get into this: I'm mostly talking about financial returns in this piece. A supplemental piece where we talk about the real-world impact each company generates will follow shortly.</p>\n\n<p>I'll briefly discuss the top five contributors and detractors from performance before comparing our performance with our index.</p>\n\n<p>## Top 5 Detractors from 2023 Performance</p>\n\n<p>**Enphase (ENPH)** was our single largest detractor from performance, which you might expect from a stock that was down roughly 50% in 2023. The solar power industry as a whole was a poor performer in 2023 thanks to changes in California's net metering laws that substantially reduced the industry's sales momentum. But we believe great businesses are built in downturns like these, and as long-term investors we have complete confidence in the management team led by the indefatigable Badri Kothandraraman.</p>\n\n<p>**Crocs (CROX) **was the second-largest detractor from performance after momentum slowed at Heydude, a footwear brand it acquired in early 2022. This has produced a degree of financial indigestion as markets struggled to make sense of what to expect from the newly combined entity. We reduced our position during the year and cannot profess blind faith in the management team. With that said, we believe shares offer compelling value at the moment, with a ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of roughly 15%.</p>\n\n<p>**Alexandria Real Estate (ARE)** was the third-largest detractor from performance as the slowing commercial real estate market affected valuations of all companies included in commercial real estate indices. But Alexandria's hyper-specialized business of providing lab space to innovative biotechnology companies can hardly be thought of as similar to mainstream commercial office buildings. We are willing to wait until the market recognizes this firm's value, and expect to be paid handsomely in the form of dividends, reinvested cash flow, and price appreciation.</p>\n\n<p>**American Tower Corporation (AMT) **We exited this position on concerns that liabilities associated with the lead cables used to connect their cellular towers to their networks were not fully contained.</p>\n\n<p>**HDFC Bank** **(HDB)** This bellwether bank has significantly lagged behind the rest of the Indian stock market as it digests a complex merger process.</p>\n\n<p>## Top 5 Contributors to 2023 Performance</p>\n\n<p>**Farmer Mac (AGM)** It's appropriate that our single largest position since inception would be the single greatest contributor to our portfolio's performance. Much of the reasoning we shared back in January 2022 remains unchanged, and we have grown the position since that post to almost 15% of our ethical growth strategy. As a portfolio manager, one of my largest fears is that the market will come to recognize the value of this unique company before I can buy even more of it.</p>\n\n<p>**Duolingo (DUOL)** The market afforded us the opportunity to buy into this remarkably impactful firm at a discount to its IPO price, and we did so in size. In the ensuing months, an old-school bubble in everything and anything vaguely linked to AI took hold, and the price appreciated significantly. We're no longer holding quite as many shares of this firm. But we challenge anyone to watch CEO Luis Von Ahn's 2011 TED talk on the thesis for Duolingo and walk away anything but inspired and excited. Today, shares are only about 70% above their summer 2021 IPO price, and the company continues to grow revenues at a remarkably stable 40% a year.</p>\n\n<p>**TopBuild (BLD)** I can't help but smile every time I think of this position, which we've held since the strategy's inception. In 2022, market prognosticators were calling for a recession, which cut the price of this insulation distributor down to half the current level because sales of insulation products are broadly seen as tied to the housing cycle. But the compelling operational footprint that this company has carefully assembled over decades combined with the real-world cost savings that good insulation offers building owners to create a wonderful financial equation as they thoughtfully consolidate their industry over the coming decades.</p>\n\n<p>**E.L.F. Beauty (ELF)** This company needs no introduction for any makeup users reading this piece. They produce cruelty-free competitors to costly beauty staples at a remarkable clip, and are experiencing accelerating revenue growth as they penetrate deeper into traditional sales channels while retaining an ironclad hold on gen-z and cost-conscious consumers. The only reason it's not a larger position in our portfolios is that our process requires us to be mindful of valuation, and the company is regularly in the most expensive decile across a range of metrics. With that said, we're likely to be shareholders for many years to come.</p>\n\n<p>**Quanta Services (PWR)** This company has a commanding position in infrastructure services, which includes renewable energy, communications, pipeline maintenance, and almost everything related to the electrical grid. Their approach to safety has long captivated me, and the company has been a prime beneficiary of the federal government's infrastructure spending. With a sales backlog that may be larger than their $30 billion market capitalization by now, this company is profoundly well prepared for whatever future may come.</p>\n\n<p>## Comparison with our Index</p>\n\n<p>On the face of things, we substantially outperformed our index last year.</p>\n\n<p>That's relatively simple to establish: The Ethical Growth strategy's 33.51% return was larger than the MSCI ACWI's 22.27% return.</p>\n\n<p>But it's also not the most complete analysis, since many of the largest contributors to the index's returns are excluded from all of our strategies for ethical reasons. These are companies like Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle, Exxon, and McDonald's that generate profits for their shareholders at great cost to the rest of us.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate a better comparison, I cross-referenced my attribution of the MSCI ACWI's returns with our proprietary ethical exclusions library to produce the chart below. It shows that applying the same ethical exclusions to our index would have reduced the index's return to less than 15%.</p>\n\n<p>This mostly serves as a reminder that there's more to portfolio management than just removing companies with sketchy practices from your portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Many investment firms will represent that they are able to take your ethical criteria and apply them to portfolio management, but it's not enough to simply eliminate the companies that act badly. For best results, you need a team that is willing to truly inhabit the restricted universe that your ethics imply.</p>\n\n<p>I'm grateful that many of you have chosen us to perform that work for you, and look forward to doing it for many years to come.</p>",

    "excerpt": "A summer update on the holdings in our flagship global opportunity strategy.",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>We work hard to identify and invest in companies that generate positive real-world impact in the same way they generate revenue.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't just about feeling good. For one thing, we consider companies with a positive, well-established role in a broader system to be more resilient than their competitors. They tend to be good stewards of their corporate assets, with well-established governance procedures and clear processes to mitigate conflicts with shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, companies are social organisms with living, breathing components. Which makes it difficult to capture what makes them special with mere statistics. Fortunately, concentration is one of the hallmarks of our investment style. Which means it's possible for us to pull together brief narratives about our holdings which you can read through at your leisure.</p>\n\n<p>This approach differs significantly from the way investment firms typically talk about impact.</p>\n\n<p>The tendency is to produce reports which focus on a handful of issues like climate, waste, and water usage. But unfortunately, this can prevent clients and other stakeholders from developing a holistic view of how the portfolio's holdings interact with the world around them. This conventional approach can also focus your attention on data that is easily comparable and readily available, which overlooks much of the nuance of a deeper analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Our approach has downsides too. It's more unwieldy than a slick infographic, short on portfolio-level statistics, and long on my own exposition. We are always looking to refine and improve our approach to this, so I hope you'll share your thoughts with us on how we can do better.</p>\n\n<p>## What's In This Strategy?</p>\n\n<p>We think of the holdings in our flagship Global Opportunity strategy as belonging to one of four verticals: Infrastructure, Innovation, Lending, and Real Estate.</p>\n\n<p>The criteria for each is relatively straightforward:</p>\n\n<p>Real Estate companies generate revenue through the sale and rental of real estate,</p>\n\n<p>Infrastructure holdings generate revenue directly from a fixed physical asset or by selling goods and services to the operators of those assets,</p>\n\n<p>Innovation holdings generate revenue through novel products or business practices, and</p>\n\n<p>Lending companies generate revenue by charging interest.</p>\n\n<p>Relative to our benchmark (The MSCI ACWI), we remain significantly underweight non-us companies at the moment, with roughly 78% of our overall holdings domiciled in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>We are also significantly overweight Real Estate, Industrials, and Financial Services stocks, and have no current positions in the Basic Materials, Energy, Healthcare or Utilities Sectors, which are roughly 22% of our index.</p>\n\n<p>The strategy's historical performance is shown below.</p>\n\n<p>## Inside the Verticals</p>\n\n<p>Breaking our portfolio down by industry verticals is helpful when analyzing our strategy. The table below shows some summary statistics for each of these four components, as well as their weight within the strategy overall.</p>\n\n<p>Our focus on companies with solid business models that generate free cash flow is immediately evident from this comparison. Our strategy has more than three times the ratio of free cash flow to market capitalization of its benchmark, which indicates that our holdings are extremely well-placed to make strategic investments or return capital to shareholders over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>Trading at roughly 60 times earnings, our Real Estate vertical might seem richly valued at first glance. We believe that current accounting earnings are not the best indicator of value for these asset-based businesses, especially in the midst of structural headwinds for the real estate industry. Our holdings are extremely well-positioned with high occupancy rates, deeply integrated into their local communities, and have been weathering the industry's recent stresses with aplomb.</p>\n\n<p>We continue to see opportunity in each of our verticals, and our due diligence pipeline is full of high-impact lenders, innovative companies with misunderstood opportunity sets, and infrastructure investments that should benefit from significant secular tailwinds.</p>\n\n<p>VerticalWeighting**Dividend Yield****PE Ratio****5 Year Revenue CAGR****FCF/Market Cap**Real Estate13.85%5.27%59.3821.07%6.27%Infrastructure24.95%0.74%20.5010.62%6.01%Innovation41.53%0.08%30.8132.52%3.50%Lending18.74%2.84%9.7612.86%25.90%Cash0.93%N/AN/AN/AN/A**Total****1.48%****27.95****21.48%****8.68%****Benchmark****1.73%****23.10****N/A****2.45%***Source: Koyfin, Ethical Capital. *</p>\n\n<p>## Top 5 Holdings</p>\n\n<p>The following five companies were the largest positions. These five positions comprised 42% of our overall holdings in this strategy as of June 3rd, 2024.</p>\n\n<p>## Agricultural Mortgage Corporation</p>\n\n<p>Vertical: Lending</p>\n\n<p>Known as Farmer Mac, this Washington D.C. based lender is a remarkable example of impact in action. Its core purpose is to increase the availability of long-term credit at stable interest rates for America's rural communities.</p>\n\n<p>The company estimates that farmers and ranchers invest $2 locally for every dollar they save on interest expenses, which means the company's impact reaches deep into areas of the country that are just plain difficult to access.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to that, the company is focused on growing its portfolio of loans to rural electricity cooperatives, which is a profound opportunity to compound their impact over time.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment Case: Farmer Mac's core financial equation is a thing of beauty. They have delivered consistent returns on equity in the high teens, and more than 90% of their revenue is recurring. On top of that, the company is well placed to serve growth markets in renewable energy, fund investments that will be necessary to increase agricultural sustainability and productivity, and deepen the resilience of our agricultural system.</p>\n\n<p>## Alexandria Real Estate</p>\n\n<p>Vertical: Real Estate</p>\n\n<p>This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is focused on creating and maintaining the mission-critical lab space that innovative biotechnology companies require to develop life-changing therapies.</p>\n\n<p>It was the first REIT to adopt this focus, and roughly three-quarters of its annual revenue comes from \"clusters\" of market-leading lab space in key centers of pharmaceutical R&D like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and North Carolina's Research Triangle.</p>\n\n<p>The company's tenants were responsible for 50% of novel FDA-approved therapies in the ten years ending 2023, which is nothing if not profound impact. And to our nerdy delight, the company has won numerous awards for the quality of its disclosures and financial reports in that period as well.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment Case: Office real estate is in the doldrums at the moment, but lab space is uniquely insulated from the industry's high-level challenges because the work that happens inside of them can't generally be done from home. The company's revenues and cash flows are growing at healthy double-digit margins, but we have been able to purchase stock at valuations unseen since the financial crisis while other investors have been fleeing the industry.</p>\n\n<p>## Duolingo</p>\n\n<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>\n\n<p>Duolingo's mission is to provide a private tutor experience to everyone on the planet through technology. Initially focused on just language learning, they have expanded their focus to include math and music in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these areas unlocks significant economic opportunity for the learners that participate in them. Learning a new language is arguably the single most effective way to enable an individual to improve their economic situation since communication is necessary for most forms of high value work.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond this, the company has used its power in the language learning market to introduce a new, lower cost, and more accessible language assessment test which is displacing the legacy Test of English as a Foreign Language, or TOEFL, which is a profound additional benefit.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment Case: Duolingo is a longstanding market leader in commercializing AI for public benefit, but it has recently come under assault from short sellers after supposedly competing translation products were unveiled by OpenAI and others. We think the threats are overblown: the company's learning system is extremely difficult to replicate, has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, and has been consistently growing revenues at more than 40% a year.</p>\n\n<p>## Lemonade</p>\n\n<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>\n\n<p>Lemonade is a public benefit corporation organized \"to harness novel business models, technologies, and private-nonprofiit partnerships to deliver insurance products where charitable giving is a core feature.\"</p>\n\n<p>That alone is profoundly innovative. But the company's management team has been incredibly creative in the way that they fund their growth plans, which adds another layer of wonderfulness to an already-exciting proposition.</p>\n\n<p>The company's insurance products have industry-leading net promoter scores around 70, and operate closer to breakeven than most insurance industry analysts tend to recognize. As their core demographic ages, we expect they will come back to Lemonade again and again.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment Case: Lemonade is well capitalized with narrowing operating losses and annual revenue growth in excess of 40%. The next two years of growth should have remarkable implications for its bottom line as the company expands past breakeven, and we were able to buy in at a fifth of their IPO price.</p>\n\n<p>## Crocs</p>\n\n<p>Vertical: Innovation</p>\n\n<p>This manufacturer of comfy clogs has been dismissed as a fad every year since they IPO'd back in 2006. But a look past the surface reveals an immensely innovative company that has consistently iterated on their core design to create something that is somehow both trendy and timeless.</p>\n\n<p>The company is also well on the way towards replacing the plastic in its shoes with renewable materials, and aims to reach 50% bio-based materials by 2030. They have also rolled out a recycling program that offers discounts on new shoes to those who participate.</p>\n\n<p>On its own, that's not so impressive. But the company has made huge strides towards enshrining comfort and utility in our popular culture, which is a significant form of impact on its own.</p>\n\n<p>The Investment Case: The company took on a significant debt load after acquiring Heydude, a complementary footwear brand, in 2022. Though concerning, this hasn't hurt the company's solid global growth trajectory, with both brands exceeding estimates as of the most recent report. As they pay down debt and continue on their growth trajectory, we expect free cash flow to continue growing by 25% or more over the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>## Next Steps</p>\n\n<p>We welcome any questions or thoughts you may have on our approach to investing in general, or this report specifically.

    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>This outcry was long overdue.</p>\n\n<p>And not just because the killing of Palestinian civilians is harrowing and wrong.</p>\n\n<p>As the person in charge of designing and implementing some of the investment industry's most stringent ethical guidelines, I can say with some authority that the world's capital markets are full of ethical catastrophes that defy easy comprehension.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, it would be something else if not Palestine.</p>\n\n<p>And it will be something else after Palestine.</p>\n\n<p>Your investment staff probably are not yet equipped to adjudicate the many complexities that come with managing money morally. But your student stakeholders are calling out for clearer moral lines about what their endowment stands to profit from.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have to tell you that we've been down this road before. With fossil fuels and for-profit prisons, tobacco companies, and plenty more. And this time around, I am urging you: take the students seriously, not just literally.</p>\n\n<p>The operational challenges of managing a modern endowment portfolio necessitate long-term planning. You've got to pace the maturation of your holdings to coincide with spending plans, produce a steady stream of consistent quality opportunities to match with incoming cash, and manage the complex communications associated with your own oversight.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you situate this entire discussion within that oversight process. The most effective way to take the students seriously is to build a moral oversight process and reporting framework that passes their muster. With such a thing in place, you will be able to make genuine long-term commitments without worrying about subsequent challenges from stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>There isn't one right way to build something like that: you will need to build and refine your own approach.</p>\n\n<p>But we've learned a few things over the past few years that might be helpful to other long-term investors thinking about how to merge a little more morality into the way they do money management.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Embrace the Challenge</p>\n\n<p>Even if they've been operating under an ESG policy for years, deeply integrating ethical criteria into investment decision making will be new for most investment offices.</p>\n\n<p>So was crypto. But unlike the blockchain stuff, building competency here is all but guaranteed to pay dividends for your organization. Think about it: this will not be the last moral issue you have to contend with. As you prune and populate your portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to have a handle on things that may impede your ability to act as a true long-term investor?</p>\n\n<p>If you are thoughtful, earnest, and perhaps lucky, you will find a way to engage with your stakeholders that becomes a source of positive idiosyncrasy. That's a big part of what makes this firm special: our clients know that I want to hear about their moral concerns ASAP. As a result, we've got our ear to the ground in ways that would be difficult to replicate for folks who are just feigning interest.</p>\n\n<p>Make a Living List</p>\n\n<p>You will want a living document that describes the conduct and products that your stakeholders consider to be objectionable.</p>\n\n<p>To make this easier, we have made our own policy available under a Creative Commons license that allows others to build upon it however they'd like. Our own policy has never felt like my property, as it has been iteratively refined in collaboration with our clients and was built upon the work that organizations like NBIM had done before us.</p>\n\n<p>Our approach is unusual in that it allows me to overrule any of the individual criteria if I see an opportunity for constructive dialogue with the company or another means for the shareholding to manifest positive impact. This gives me substantial flexibility to use the tools at my disposal to drive impact, and avoids making ethical oversight into a box-ticking exercise.</p>\n\n<p>You Won't Miss the Stuff You Exclude</p>\n\n<p>I've overseen our process for almost three years at this point, and I'm still surprised how little I miss the companies that we've excluded for ethical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>There are almost 3,000 issuers on our exclusion list for all manner of conduct and product-related sins. Of those companies, there are only a handful that I would consider sensible investments. The majority are on there for more than one reason. And when we update our exclusions to include new criteria, we often find new and exciting reasons not to miss them.</p>\n\n<p>I believe there is an existential link between governance, ethics, and investability. And if you manage to identify that companies have endemic ethics problems, why wouldn't you remove them from your investable universe?</p>\n\n<p>Aquiesce to Active</p>\n\n<p>Ethical investing is active investment management. It is foolish to pretend otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>You can spend a lot of time and effort worrying about how to mean-variance optimize your holdings so that their volatility patterns match those of a broader index, but you'll miss a profound opportunity to recontextualize your investment program in the process. Your required rate of return is likely your ultimate benchmark, so why not use it instead of legacy indices?</p>\n\n<p>After all, if you embark on an honest and searching divestment journey, it's likely that your holdings will look a lot different than the S&P 500. And it will be a journey. I wrote an essay reflecting on my own path a few years ago that may be useful.</p>\n\n<p>Harness The Energy of your Stakeholders</p>\n\n<p>I can't remember a time when young people were this interested in what's happening inside of their University's endowments. If I were working in one of these offices, I would be looking for ways to listen to these folks on an ongoing basis.</p>\n\n<p>Why not survey students on a wide range of ethical issues to see where they stand? Or work to identify types of investments that would appeal to these stakeholders?</p>\n\n<p>It can't be that hard to hire a facilitator to tease out the things that would be seen as exciting or equitable, and that idea generation work may lead to tangible opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Ask for Help</p>\n\n<p>I probably only have the bandwidth to engage in-depth with one investment office on this outside of facilitating access to our flagship strategy. But there are plenty of others out there who could be helpful, and I happen to be friendly with a lot of them.</p>\n\n<p>Send us a note if you'd like us to provide some ideas confidentially. But this suggestion goes far beyond anything I, my firm, or our community can do for you.</p>\n\n<p>After all, the broad debate about divestment can get heated. But you've risen to the height of our profession, and likely have wise people whose counsel you rely on. As I said above, you'll need to evolve your own response to these student demands. Don't deprive yourself of their counsel.</p>\n\n<p>For more of our thoughts on divestment, click here.</p>",

    "excerpt": "If you want to understand the future of energy, the first step is to embrace subtlety.",
    "content": "[]",
    "body": "<p>Larry Siegel recently put forward the argument that radically reducing carbon emissions is incompatible with civilization on a planet of eight billion people.</p>\n\n<p>He goes on to argue:</p>\n\n<p>A full energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables will not happen. We are going to continue to emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and, as the economist and blogger Tyler Cowen is reputed to have said, “Mostly we’re going to see how hot it gets.”</p>\n\n<p>I have tremendous respect for Larry. His work as Director of Research at the CFA Institute Research Foundation was a big part of my life in the nine years I spent on staff at CFA Institute. But the dichotomy between sustainability and prosperity that he presents is false. And his logic is not just flawed, but also seductive and therefore dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, it wouldn’t be particularly useful of me to simply say that I disagree. The investment community is rife with differences of opinion: they’re literally required in order for the market to function. So I see it as my responsibility to not only wade into this discussion, but to voice my dissent constructively.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture of Larry’s argument is fairly straightforward:</p>\n\n<p>Access to energy is a necessary precondition for economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Energy demand will increase as countries in the global south grow their economies.</p>\n\n<p>Meeting all this demand with current renewable energy technologies is not plausible.</p>\n\n<p>Fossil fuels are therefore the only way to meet the demand.</p>\n\n<p>Preventing climate change is impossible given all the fossil fuels we must burn, so all we can do is adapt to it.</p>\n\n<p>Much of this is undeniable, but also incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>The climate has already changed in ways that may be irreversible, so it’s impossible to disagree with Larry’s conclusion that we ought to focus on adapting to climate change instead of preventing it.</p>\n\n<p>But after thoughtful consideration of what adaptation might actually cost and involve, it’s similarly impossible to conclude that blindly increasing our consumption of fossil fuels in a bid to boost growth is a sane path forward. The costs associated with Larry’s plan would be profound, the growth he claims it would unlock may never materialize, and the ethics of putting such a plan forward are immensely problematic.</p>\n\n<p>Over the following paragraphs, we’ll take a deep look at what adapting to climate change actually means. Over the course of that exploration, it will become clear that the risks of acceding to this proposed future far outweigh the potential benefits.</p>\n\n<p>## We Can’t Know What Comes Next</p>\n\n<p>I wish we could take it as a given that the global south will experience the economic growth it needs over the coming decade.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, a recent World Bank report makes this impossible. The authors examined the seventy-five countries eligible for loans and grants from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), which are the poorest countries in the world by definition, and found some disquieting results.</p>\n\n<p>The headline is stark: more than half of these countries are growing more slowly than the rich world. And fully one third of them are poorer today than they were at the onset of the COVID pandemic. This is a significant change from the past: We have to look back to the late 1990s in order to find a period where broadly increasing prosperity was this unusual.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t tell you exactly why this is, but here’s one contributing factor: over the course of the last thirty years, jobs have reliably been created in lower cost economies as supply chains globalized in search of the most capital-efficient means of production. But after the frailties of this system were laid bare by the global pandemic, global companies began to “nearshore” or “friendshore” their operations in order to mitigate exposure to future shocks.</p>\n\n<p>Firm-level benefits aside, further fragmentation of the previous world order is likely to have chilling effects on global economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>A recent IMF working paper estimates a long-term global GDP loss of 4.5 percent if global economic integration reverts to its level in the year 2000, which was before China joined the World Trade Organization. Almost everyone would be worse off in this scenario, especially if tariffs and other barriers to trade were to be enacted as “corrective” measures.</p>\n\n<p>And regrettably, some degree of such action is likely in the near future. To be clear: I am not predicting this. And I am certainly not rooting for it.</p>\n\n<p>But the reality is simple: broader, more inclusive global growth is not a foregone conclusion under any circumstances. Trends in global trade patterns that made it seem that way may be reverting just as costly challenges are materializing.</p>\n\n<p>Climate change is one of the most significant such challenges. Natural disasters already cost the average IDA country 1.3% of its GDP per year, and that has roughly doubled in recent decades. And though it’s difficult to know exactly what will happen as the climate changes, the consensus view is that these disasters will intensify.</p>\n\n<p>## Let’s See How Hot it Gets</p>\n\n<p>Here in the intermountain west, it’s already obvious that a little bit of warming goes a long way. There is more than 300 million tons of dead wood in Colorado’s forests that’s rapidly drying into tinder for future wildfires.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t just nightmare fuel. It’s also the state’s fastest growing forest carbon pool.</p>\n\n<p>New, healthy trees don’t automatically grow back in their place because the ecological niches these species have evolved to inhabit no longer exist.</p>\n\n<p>This is far from an aesthetic consideration: these trees have historically provided a far-reaching suite of services to the surrounding ecosystems. And even if we had the data and audacity to claim that we fully understand these support structures, we won’t be able to replicate them without colossal, costly effort.</p>\n\n<p>This single spillover effect from climate change has already turned the skies in New York City orange, caused more than half of the most dangerous air pollution in the American West, and left our ecosystems vulnerable to invasive species.</p>\n\n<p>And this is ground truth, not a projection.</p>\n\n<p>If we move towards the future on the path Larry proposes, we have no ready means of knowing what we will unleash.</p>\n\n<p>The climate scientist slang for a future of fossil-fueled economic development is “taking the highway,” and the IPCC has a dedicated model to describe it. They refer to it as Shared Socioeconomic Pathway(SSP) 5-8.5.</p>\n\n<p>It's really quite a fascinating model, but it can be difficult to draw functional conclusions from without a bit of help. Fortunately, a new web app from spatial ecologist Matthew Fitzpatrick at the University of Maryland can help us imagine the disruptions that lurk down that path.</p>\n\n<p>The app extends and updates a 2019 analysis published in Nature Communications to allow anyone to see how the climate is likely to change in 40,581 places and 5,323 cities around the world under SSP5-8.5.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these allegories are dramatic: “If you happen to live in New York City, you would need to travel to northern Mississippi to experience what New York is expected to feel like by 2080. Say hello to hot, really humid summers and goodbye to snow in winter.”</p>\n\n<p>But the profound danger of Larry’s plan becomes even clearer when we take a tour through the largest equatorial cities. By 2080, the climate in Lagos, Kinshasa, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Riyadh, Accra, Dar Es Salaam, and Manila will have changed so starkly that there is nowhere on earth we can look to as an analogy. And that’s not a complete list.</p>\n\n<p>Taipei and Singapore will suffer the same fate, so in this future we can at least look forward to a tidy natural experiment that will demonstrate whether — and to what extent — wealth will work to shield us against an unearthly reality.</p>\n\n<p>Not everything is bad and getting worse. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is back to record coral cover, for instance. And though that should cheer us, it’s important to remember that these advances come after a $5 billion funding commitment from the government of Australia.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, it’s reasonable to wonder what other costs would mount as the planet warms further. And remember that proceeding upon a development path that ignores those costs creates liabilities that will encumber future economic growth when they come due.</p>\n\n<p>On this subject, my central insight is not that hard to grasp: it’s much simpler to avoid a mess than clean up after one. The interlinked ecological systems affected by the climate are profoundly complex and already struggling.</p>\n\n<p>Investment professionals like me and Larry have a clear role to play in helping society navigate the implications of this, but we’ll need to have a good, hard look at our professional ethics in order to do that effectively.</p>\n\n<p>## Capital Gains for Me, Ruin For Thee</p>\n\n<p>My most profound misgiving about Larry’s line of argumentation is that he will not experience anything close to the worst outcomes of climate change.</p>\n\n<p>As a fellow American and member of the investor class, both he and I are not just geographically remote from the worst of these outcomes, but will likely be able to afford whatever tech-enabled tools arise to mitigate the reality he advocates for.</p>\n\n<p>Most folks in the global south would have no such succor, yet Larry would say he is writing out of concern for their prosperity. Underneath a chart that presents a clear linear relationship between energy use per capita and GDP per capita, he writes:</p>\n\n<p>“Economic growth is pushing almost every country… toward prosperity. Pushing them back… would be the cruelest joke ever played on what Frantz Fanon called “the wretched of the Earth.”</p>\n\n<p>I would hate to be involved in a cruel joke of any form, so let’s embrace the premise that there’s a straightforward path to sustained growth in any given country for a second. We’ll restrict our analysis to a single country - the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to keep things fairly tangible.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that after adopting our fossil fuel led development agenda, Congolese GDP grows constantly at the fastest clip observed in any single year since 1960 — 9.7% — for each of the fifty-five years between us and the year 2080. Assuming no change to population size, their GDP per capita would reach roughly the same level we enjoy today in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Would that be worth it?</p>\n\n<p>From the narrow standpoint of global investors, maybe. Even just one growth story of that magnitude would unleash a bonanza for us capital markets types. And if we buy the premise that Larry’s plan would unlock growth of a similar magnitude across the global south, it gets very easy to anticipate describing our net worths with an extra comma or two.</p>\n\n<p>But at what cost, and to whom?</p>\n\n<p>After 5°C worth of global warming, any remaining Kinshasans would likely have to contend with fatal wet bulb temperatures throughout the rainy season. It’s possible that the mining industry would find ways to keep employees safe enough to keep the flow of critical minerals going, but that might involve wearing something akin to a space suit whenever they go outside. The agricultural sector — which currently employs about three-fourths of the country’s labor force — would be eviscerated.</p>\n\n<p>Are the people of the Congo asking for this? Do they have the strong democratic institutions that would be necessary to grant their informed consent? We can certainly find individuals who align with Larry’s thinking, but that’s a long way away from a popular consensus.</p>\n\n<p>The moral argument Larry makes is particularly seductive to western ears. But I’d like to foreground something James Baldwin said in the 1970 documentary Meeting the Man: James Baldwin in Paris as we explore it.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the quote:</p>\n\n<p>You, the English, you, the French, you, the West, you, the Christians. You can't help but feel that there is something you can do for me. That you can save me. And you do not yet know that I have endured your salvation so long, I cannot afford it anymore.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot here is straightforward: whatever their motivations, western interventions aimed at promoting prosperity are not necessarily welcomed by the folks they seek to support.</p>\n\n<p>Think about how much would need to go right for future Congolese people to celebrate this plan retrospectively.</p>\n\n<p>Growth would have to come fast, then last.</p>\n\n<p>And even more unlikely: we must assume that both the political will to do something about all of the resulting negative externalities and the technology to actually get that done would arise at some point.</p>\n\n<p>## Why Are They Excited About This Again?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to run the risk of mischaracterizing Larry or Mark Mills, the analyst he quotes extensively in his essay. So there’s a big quote from them coming soon. But because their argument talks a lot about GDP growth, I’ll first remind you that Simon Kuznets — the economist who came up with GDP — had the following to say about it:</p>\n\n<p>GDP 'measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p>I hope having that handy makes the next few paragraphs a bit more fun for you:</p>\n\n<p>The proportion of the world’s GDP spent on energy-in-the-large, including food and animal feed, has decreased by an order of magnitude since the early modern era. A society that spends upwards of 70 percent of its income on food and fodder is poor indeed….</p>\n\n<p>But energy costs as a share of GDP didn’t really fall off a cliff until the rapid industrialization of the nineteenth century, powered by coal and then oil and gas.</p>\n\n<p>This may be counterintuitive: don’t heavy industries use a lot of energy? Yes, but an industrial economy is so much more productive than an agricultural and handcraft economy that the denominator – world GDP – grew massively.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the energy share fell even as the absolute consumption of energy soared. Interestingly, the energy share of GDP has remained about the same – around 10 percent –since the early 1900s.</p>\n\n<p>This is not because energy use remained stable, but because energy use and economic output exploded upward roughly in tandem.</p>\n\n<p>It’s interesting that Larry and Mark celebrate the role of technological development in producing this output explosion, but neglect to consider it in their analysis of renewable energy technologies. Their case that the energy needed to fuel growth must come from fossil fuels rests on the unstated assumption that renewables technology will not improve.</p>\n\n<p>This is ahistorical.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of building new wind and solar facilities has declined by orders of magnitude over the past twenty years while their efficiency has grown by leaps and bounds. And new battery chemistries are emerging based on plentiful, inexpensive minerals like sodium which may further reshape the energy landscape over coming decades.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, today’s renewable energy technologies may not be able to fulfill global energy demand, but tomorrow’s might.</p>\n\n<p>The 18th century economist Thomas Malthus used similar logic to argue that the supply of food could not keep pace with the growth of the human population. But new developments in agricultural technology intervened and our planet is now home to roughly eight times as many humans who enjoy a much higher standard of living than those ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>So as we consider the argument that fossil fuels are the only source capable of meeting our energy needs, let’s remember that things have a way of changing. The first patents for solar panels and wind turbines were only granted in the 1880s, and they’ve since evolved from novelties into economically viable alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly important because the path Larry and Mark propose has significant costs in addition to money. Average temperatures have already risen by .8°C relative to their average between 1961 and 1990, and it’s worth underlining that the order-of-magnitude increases in quality of living as measured by the cost of food and fodder had already materialized by 1900.</p>\n\n<p>We have cell phones and the internet now, but also PFAS, and — according to a great report from the Republican side of Congress’ Joint Economic Committee — a level of mortality from deaths of despair like suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that “surpasses anything seen in America since the dawn of the 20th century.”</p>\n\n<p>There’s one thing we never had back then: plastic.</p>\n\n<p>That's not particularly interesting at first glance. Production volume in almost everything has grown by leaps and bounds in the postwar period. But there is one particularly pertinent thing to remember about plastics: they’re made of oil.</p>\n\n<p>And demand for them is a huge part of global oil demand. To wit: the International Energy Agency’s latest medium-term oil outlook notes that Chinese imports of plastic polymers, synthetic fibers like polyester, and other intermediate petrochemicals produced roughly as much oil demand as the entire country of Germany in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The authors expect rising demand for petrochemicals (which, to be fair, is a much broader category than just plastics) to drive roughly three quarters of the increase in global oil demand between now and 2030.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s worth remembering as you read the first sentence of Larry’s concluding section, which notes:</p>\n\n<p>Some would say that it’s worth sacrificing almost everything we value in life to “save the planet.”</p>\n\n<p>When the discussion is framed that way, it’s easy to overlook the many tangible steps that can be taken to mitigate the negative effects of fossil fuel consumption.</p>\n\n<p>I doubt anyone would sign up to live in an unrecognizable world in order to preserve some semblance of normalcy. But that’s exactly the world that will result from Larry’s proposed path forward: just think about all of the cities with an unearthly future that we’ve talked about.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, a future with less plentiful polymers is a lot easier to stomach. Wouldn’t you be willing to give up plastic bottles and polyester for a chance at a more sustainable future? Wading into trade-offs like this is at the heart of effective adaptation to climate change, which Larry and I agree is absolutely essential.</p>\n\n<p>So what does it look like to take that challenge seriously?</p>\n\n<p>## Arise, Acolytes of Adaptation!</p>\n\n<p>We won’t make progress on anything without a cogent and comprehensive definition of the problem we’re dealing with.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about climate change, we’re often referring to a more complex set of changes linked to the consequences of human activity on the surrounding environment.</p>\n\n<p>A team of researchers has helpfully enumerated each of the nine planetary processes that are essential for maintaining the stability and resilience of the earth as a whole. The extra large illustration below shows those nine systems, as well as the riskiness of their current state.</p>\n\n<p>*Source: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research*</p>\n\n<p>Climate change is just one of these nine processes, and CO2 concentration is not even its most acutely stressed facet at the moment. That distinction belongs to radiative forcing, which is what happens when the amount of energy entering earth’s atmosphere is greater than the amount that leaves it.</p>\n\n<p>This framework invites us to think about the sustainability of activities in a fuller context. Take cutting down a forest for example: it has carbon implications to be sure, but also can lead the earth to absorb more solar radiation if the ground is darker than the forest that used to cover it.</p>\n\n<p>Such activity also removes habitat, which can lead to the endangerment and extinction of species and a loss of genetic diversity in the biosphere. If the forest were to be replaced with farmland, there would likely also be increases in biogeochemical flows from the introduction of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. Pesticides and other chemicals would likely come alongside them, introducing novel entities into the environment. And the farm would also have to be irrigated, which presages changes in freshwater use.</p>\n\n<p>These connections are straightforward once they’ve been illuminated, but will likely be new to most readers. If nothing else, they highlight how intricately linked these systems are and allow us to imagine the non-monetary costs associated with upsetting them further.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s not all: they are also confounding for ideologues, who often put forward one big solution for all of the planet’s woes.</p>\n\n<p>Take electrification for example. The quote below that Larry shares from Mark Mills is undeniably true today:</p>\n\n<p>The world already digs up an amount of earth equal to 7000 Great Pyramids per year to shift from gas, oil, and coal to the minerals required for the energy transition. These include nickel, cadmium, tellurium, obviously lithium, and cobalt among other minerals. You would have to dig up 50,000 Pyramids’ worth of the Earth each year to get [enough of] those minerals [to complete the transition].</p>\n\n<p>All of that mining already has drastic consequences for the biosphere. To keep this essay readable, I’ll refrain from enumerating all of them.</p>\n\n<p>But readers rooting for the immediate and wholesale replacement of fossil fuels should be aware that they’re advocating for something with profound spillover effects.</p>\n\n<p>So where does that leave us?</p>\n\n<p>The messy gray area where progress actually happens.</p>\n\n<p>In a perfect world, we could rely on a combination of environmental markets and regulation to accurately price the external costs associated with all human activities.</p>\n\n<p>That world sounds nice, but we don't live there.</p>\n\n<p>So as we think about how to reduce the harm associated with human activity, we need to resist one size fits all solutions and seek instead to understand the checkerboard of local realities that create the global energy picture. And the reality is that burning oil or natural gas would be a huge improvement in some places, since it would replace dirtier energy sources like coal.</p>\n\n<p>For as long as the world remains imperfect, it’s incumbent upon analysts like me and Larry to embrace the reality that many things can be true at once. There is no “magic bullet” solution waiting in the wings to relieve our planet’s many stresses, nor a simple tradeoff between economic growth and sustainability.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a world with finite resources but infinite desires. And over the past century, we’ve allowed those desires to set the economic agenda without much interference.</p>\n\n<p>None of us can put forward a complete solution to solve the climate crisis while preserving our economic prosperity, and we should acknowledge that at every opportunity. After all, we are in the business of making decisions amid conditions of uncertainty. And people often think that means we know much more than we actually do.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why, as we close this exploration, it feels important to draw attention to the malignant overconfidence with which us finance types can sometimes trod through thorny ethical terrain.</p>\n\n<p>If we come to believe that we can speak with certitude on behalf of people we have never met about their own best interest, we imperil our ability to serve our social function, weaken our standing as a profession, and diminish ourselves individually in the process.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing we can know about the future is that it's coming. The fuel that powers it, the technology that shapes it, and the people we’ll share it with are yet to be determined. But it’s likely that the world will stay an inherently subtle place no matter what happens, and I hope me and my colleagues at Ethical Capital will be here to help you embrace that nuance.</p>\n\n<p>[forminator_form id=\"8534\"]</p>",

Are they heading toward a series of rate cuts?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"ed1j\\\">The Federal Reserve is and has always been data-dependent, which means they are responding to the underlying economic reality in an adaptive way. There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They\\u2019re a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"5u3bh\\\"><b>What was your reaction to the Fed\\u2019s decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"6jetm\\\">I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn\\u2019t get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn\\u2019t really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"utvk\\\"><b>What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"1vcv2\\\">We\\u2019ve seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it\\u2019s insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"4ptp0\\\"><b>How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"35das\\\">This is where the impact of the Fed\\u2019s action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it\\u2019s hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won\\u2019t be helpful at the margin.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"6k81k\\\">On the saver\\u2019s side of things, there\\u2019s likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it\\u2019s important to remember that we\\u2019ve been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"amjc\\\">On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That\\u2019s because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don\\u2019t consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"6m1rm\\\">People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"fr98u\\\"><b>How will the rate cut affect the average American?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"6s3jv\\\">I\\u2019m not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it\\u2019s hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"32lod\\\">Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they\\u2019re not indebted because of moral failure; they\\u2019re indebted because it\\u2019s hard to make ends meet.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"7sn48\\\">That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"21vt4\\\"><b>Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"brc6l\\\">Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That\\u2019s how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it\\u2019s important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"saoh\\\">We\\u2019ve been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders\\u2019 needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we\\u2019ve been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it\\u2019s trading at a cash flow yield that\\u2019s more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p><p data-block-key=\\\"bi4cc\\\">We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"eum38\\\"><b>What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"djogj\\\">I generally don\\u2019t think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we\\u2019ve experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it\\u2019s kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"b99n1\\\">I think that\\u2019s because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they\\u2019ve locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don\\u2019t get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"25n0\\\">That\\u2019s not to say bank savings products don\\u2019t have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you\\u2019re going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"65nt3\\\"><b>Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"23qbo\\\">We\\u2019re going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"fdbc9\\\">But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"8bpoe\\\">So anybody who\\u2019s got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it\\u2019s likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"7ar5a\\\">But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it\\u2019s a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don\\u2019t. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"5df1l\\\">It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"6qouq\\\">That basic engine is fundamentally human. It\\u2019s what\\u2019s behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"fms3t\\\"><b>How do you think the Fed\\u2019s recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</b></p><p data-block-key=\\\"fnl9i\\\">I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That\\u2019s not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There\\u2019s a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>\"}]",

There has been some criticism that they have been a little slow to cut, but I think people need to understand that rate cuts are not something to get excited about. They're a symptom of a weakening economy! So, I expect that if we continue to see signs of developing weakness, we will continue to see cuts, but I would be shocked if they depart from that data-dependent framework.</p><p data-block-key=\"5u6d9\">What was your reaction to the Fed's decision to cut rates by 0.50%, higher than the typical 0.25% reduction?</p><p data-block-key=\"a3pvw\">I think they did their job. The markets would have rebelled if they didn't get some kind of concerted action and a tangible response to the criticism that the Fed has been behind the curve in the economic cycle. It doesn't really factor into the way that we view companies or the way that we see the world, except that we are grateful to have a prudent central bank that acts in a disciplined way to advance its dual mandate of managing inflation and unemployment.</p><p data-block-key=\"pbzf3\">What will a rate cut (or cuts) mean for stock market investors? Any big changes?</p><p data-block-key=\"yi3kc\">We've seen a rally in some of the more interest rate-sensitive, lower quality companies that tend to have a lot of debt. But for most long-term investors, it's insane to be predicating investment decisions on reading the tea leaves and trying to see what a couple of guys in Washington are going to do in the near term. The heart of building portfolios is finding fundamental economic needs addressed by good companies and owning them throughout whatever may come. That is not going to change because of an act of the Federal Reserve, no matter what the action.</p><p data-block-key=\"fe8ji\">How will the rate cut impact various sectors like housing, loans, and savings?</p><p data-block-key=\"f8uoh\">This is where the impact of the Fed's action is really going to be felt. A lot of loans and savings products are floating rate, which means that when interest rates change, so does the yield that savers receive and borrowers pay. I know a lot of households are feeling anxiety right now, and it's hard to imagine that a slightly lower interest payment won't be helpful at the margin.</p><p data-block-key=\"kzgnf\">On the saver's side of things, there's likely to be increased concern about how to generate income from capital. But it will remain possible, and it's important to remember that we've been through a period of really low interest rates that lasted for most of my adult life, so we will get through this.</p><p data-block-key=\"424j3\">On the corporate side of things, a lot of lower-quality companies have effectively gotten a reprieve from the lowering of interest rates. That's because they often carry large amounts of debt, and the reduction in interest rates flows almost directly to their bottom line. I expect that will be a relatively passing phenomenon. I don't consider that to be a way to build durable value.</p><p data-block-key=\"qegty\">People who are in debt, especially the most indebted folks, are breathing a small sigh of relief for sure.</p><p data-block-key=\"aowkp\">How will the rate cut affect the average American?</p><p data-block-key=\"dgvd0\">I'm not sure the rate cut will affect the average American, but the conditions that gave rise to it certainly will. The Fed was pointing to increased risks to the unemployment outlook in their release, and it's hard to imagine that not affecting the average American. The government support during Covid led to household balance sheets that were unusually cash-rich for the United States, and that effect has largely subsided by now. The money has been spent.</p><p data-block-key=\"7k8tp\">Against this backdrop, a lot of people are having a hard time getting by. We see that the most indebted folks are really having a tough time. And they're not indebted because of moral failure; they're indebted because it's hard to make ends meet.</p><p data-block-key=\"dnmnm\">That creates a precarity that tends to pervade how one sees the world. And so I think at a very deep level, every American has been affected by this underlying reality.</p><p data-block-key=\"sq9ue\">Should market investors look for opportunities during a rate cut phase? If so, what stock market opportunities might work for them?</p><p data-block-key=\"ptefo\">Investors should always be looking for opportunities. That's how we keep our portfolios fresh! This is a business where you have to kill your darlings (sell positions you like) sometimes in order to stay disciplined, which means it's important to be continuously looking at what else you could own instead of only focusing on the things that you currently own.</p><p data-block-key=\"lppnm\">We've been finding significant opportunities overseas. A lot of European industrial companies are regarded poorly by international investors, but we find that they are often very high-quality companies trading at compelling valuations with an acute appreciation of their stakeholders' needs. Over the course of the last couple of months, we've been able to upgrade and upgrade and upgrade our Growth portfolio (our flagship long-term investment strategy) to the point where it's trading at a cash flow yield that's more than five times that of our index. Those opportunities are out there!</p><p data-block-key=\"hvs70\">We also manage an income strategy that has had a really excellent couple of months of performance by investing in preferred stocks, pools of loans, and longer-maturity corporate bonds. I expect that approach will continue to pay dividends both figuratively and literally.</p><p data-block-key=\"kici5\">What about bank savers (CDs and money markets)? What does a rate cut or two mean for them?</p><p data-block-key=\"b462c\">I generally don't think that long-term investors should be using bank savings products for a couple of reasons. First of all, CDs in the best cases generate rates of return that are not much higher than the inflation we've experienced. It can be riskier, but for people who genuinely are trying to put money away for a longer period of time, I think it's kind of foolish not to get the capital markets involved at least a little bit.</p><p data-block-key=\"lmz7h\">I think that's because CDs are basically contracts in which the bank wins no matter what interest rates do. If rates go up, they've locked you in at an existing rate. If rates go down, you don't get any mark-to-market appreciation from the value of your investment. All you get back is your principal instead of interest. Whereas with a bond, if you took out an 8% bond and rates went from 8% to 6%, you would be sitting on a hefty gain if the bond was relatively long-dated.</p><p data-block-key=\"9na7q\">That's not to say bank savings products don't have a purpose, but that purpose is often to serve very specific short and intermediate-term needs, like saving for a down payment on a house or putting money that you're going to spend on tuition somewhere so it gets a little bit of yield before it gets sent out the door. Those are appropriate uses for money market funds and CDs. But I find that many bank savers I meet do not explore these other options, and they really should.</p><p data-block-key=\"dfboo\">Any advice for investors concerned about falling interest rates and the impact on their investment and retirement portfolios?</p><p data-block-key=\"262wu\">We're going to get through this. There are still ways to generate income. There are still ways to generate capital gains. Those will not change because of interest rates.</p><p data-block-key=\"bzgiu\">But with that said, a lot of investors are operating strategies that are really more mismatched collections of tactics than truly well-thought-out investment portfolios. In general, I think fretting a lot about Fed decisions, elections, or anything like that is a symptom of an underdeveloped investment strategy.</p><p data-block-key=\"1twy6\">So anybody who's got these concerns should either call up their advisor and have a conversation or get one, because it's likely that there is a speculative element in their portfolio design that they may not even be conscious of.</p><p data-block-key=\"jyhy3\">But I mean, think about it. Interest rates were pretty close to zero for most of my adult life. This moment of real tangible interest rates has been a nice breather. But it's a departure from recent history, and I worry that it may have deceived some investors into thinking that risk-free returns exist. The reality is that they don't. Even if the risks are minimal, they still exist.</p><p data-block-key=\"ohj5k\">It can be kind of scary to hear that because it implies that we live in this very flimsy world. But I don't think that's the case. Throughout history, humans have found ways to respond to challenging situations and generate shared value in the process.</p><p data-block-key=\"kczor\">That basic engine is fundamentally human. It's what's behind all of the investment returns that are generated in your portfolio. That adaptive force is innate to markets, and I think understanding and appreciating it gives us a real sense of their beauty and resilience.</p><p data-block-key=\"wk9ut\">How do you think the Fed's recent rate cut will impact inflation, the job market, and GDP growth?</p><p data-block-key=\"a7382\">I think it will help keep inflation and expectations under control and provide a little bit of support to the job market at the margin. But I don't think it's going to be a material factor in driving GDP growth. That's not the point of Federal Reserve policy. They are trying to minimize inflation and control unemployment, not manage growth. There's a clear interplay between what they do and GDP growth, but it would be concerning if they began to make decisions with an eye towards short-term economic numbers.</p>",
