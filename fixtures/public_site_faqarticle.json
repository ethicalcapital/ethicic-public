Before we get to whether or not you should, here's a bit of an overview of what securities lending is.</p>\n\n<p>Securities lending involves temporarily transferring securities, such as stocks or bonds, from one party (the lender) to another (the borrower).</p>\n\n<p>The borrower typically needs these securities to cover short positions, facilitate trading strategies, or meet collateral requirements. In return, the borrower provides collateral, usually in the form of cash or other securities, to the lender and pays a lending fee.</p>\n\n<p>This activity can be somewhat abstract. If you're relatively new to markets, that's sort of scary on its own. But the risks of allowing your securities to be lent out are extremely limited. And in many cases, the firms sponsoring these securities lending programs share the extra income with clients.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Altruist, those fees are not shared with our clients. So while we do not see a tangible harm to participating in this program at this time we also don't mind if our clients opt out of it.</p>",

The most effective donors tend to view it as something they try to get better at over time, and often develop an intensely personal sense of what matters.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, even though it would be amazing to make a huge donation to your favorite organization through great personal sacrifice, it would be much healthier to support them in ways that are sustainable for you.</p>\n\n<p>That can include giving non-monetary resources like your time and energy, but also remembering that you're no good to the causes you care about if you don't take care of yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Think about what they tell you on airplanes: 'put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting other passengers.' This is intensely practical! If you help others without thinking about yourself, you stand a very good chance of making things worse overall by putting yourself into a position where you need saving.</p>\n\n<p>So what should you do? Here are a couple of steps that might feel productive and impactful apart from volunteering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the organizations you'd like to support and put them in your will. That way the organizations you care about will get your resources when you're no longer using them.</li>\n<li>Organize a get-together with a suggested donation to your favorite organization. For bonus points, provide some resources to the folks who attend that help them see why the cause matters to you.</li>\n<li>Spend time amplifying messages from activists and organizations you care about on your social media platforms.</li>\n<li>Decide in advance to give a percentage of any extra money you come into to causes you care about, but only if it doesn't put your personal finances in peril.</li>\n<li>Take steps to be someone that others can rely on in emergency situations by keeping things like naloxone and band-aids handy while you're out moving through the world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most important thing to remember is that you're not alone. As you navigate these complex tradeoffs, please never hesitate to use the team at Ethical Capital as a resource.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Jasmine Rashid for asking these questions in her newsletter and inspiring us to pull this help page together.</p>",

Transparency Increases</h3>\n<p>Markets work best with perfect information. By demanding radical transparency and sharing what we learn, we help markets price in true costs and benefits.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Time Horizons Extend</h3>\n<p>Short-termism drives many harmful behaviors. By investing for the long term and supporting companies that do the same, we can align capitalism with sustainability.</p>\n\n<h2>Real-World Examples</h2>\n<p>We see ethical capitalism working in companies that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay living wages and provide good benefits</li>\n<li>Invest in renewable energy and circular economy</li>\n<li>Create products that genuinely improve lives</li>\n<li>Build wealth in underserved communities</li>\n<li>Practice radical transparency and accountability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Path Forward</h2>\n<p>Making capitalism ethical requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individual Action:</strong> Aligning our investments with our values</li>\n<li><strong>Collective Power:</strong> Building communities of conscious investors</li>\n<li><strong>Systemic Change:</strong> Advocating for policies that internalize costs</li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Shift:</strong> Redefining success beyond pure profit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Our Commitment</h2>\n<p>At Ethical Capital, we're proving that ethical investing isn't just possible - it's profitable. By carefully selecting companies that do well by doing good, we're building portfolios that generate both returns and positive impact.</p>\n\n<p>The question isn't whether capitalism can be ethical. The question is whether we'll choose to make it so. Every investment decision is an opportunity to vote for the economy we want to see.</p>\n\n<p>Join us in building a more conscious, ethical form of capitalism - one investment at a time.</p>",
