For instance, we devoted a section of our client letter to discussion of how one of our companies, a real estate investment trust, was able to preserve a historic mill as a center of commerce in a rural town. We then emphasised that the firm's strategy of building multi-use developments makes this part of a pattern, not a photogenic show piece.</p>\n    \n    <h3>4.2 Which disclosure initiatives and regulatory regimes influence client reporting?</h3>\n    <p>We are not subject to jurisdiction-specific regulation or reporting, and do not report in alignment with any third-party framework.</p>\n    \n    <h3>4.3 How does your organisation audit the quality of its responsible investment processes and data?</h3>\n    <p>We routinely look for third-party groups that credibly assess companies for their alignment with various indicators of sound corporate practice, and will routinely spot check our exclusions to ensure that we are adequately incorporating the latest and deepest analysis of companies implicated in objectionable behavior.</p>\n    \n    <p>Additionally, we seek to update our internal assessments of our investable universe no less than quarterly, which helps us ensure that we are consistently and coherently aligning with the best opportunities in our coverage universe.</p>\n    ",
      "additional_content": "\n    <h3>5.1 How does your organisation manage its internal ESG risks, opportunities and impacts?</h3>\n    <p>Our internal approach to managing ESG risks is relatively radical, and involves avoiding flights wherever possible, partnering with a sibling company to originate high-quality carbon removals, and continuously seeking community with others in the investment community to exceed our own expectations.</p>\n    \n    <h3>5.2 Additional information on our responsible investment approach</h3>\n    <p>We believe that the investment industry's \"original sin\" is the way it prioritises the perspectives of the wealthy over all other stakeholders.</p>\n    \n    <p>Our firm has been designed to counteract this by ensuring that our strategies are both accessible and understandable to clients regardless of how much wealth they happen to have access to. This is a structural governance advantage, as it allows us to not only serve a more diverse client base than traditional wealth managers, but also maintain direct dialogue with individuals that are deeply engaged with sustainability themes.</p>\n    ",
