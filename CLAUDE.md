## Development Memories
- if you update the garden views in the web container, implement the same change in the public container.
- dont use hardcoded styles in css -- use our garden ui variables so that we dont have issues applying styles in the future
- **NEVER use hardcoded colors in CSS** - ALL colors must use Garden UI theme variables for centralized theme management
- **Prefer @core/widgets/ components** wherever possible for consistent UI patterns and behavior
- dont make up things on our public website. DO NOT
- when i ask you to help me edit content, make ONLY the edits i explicitly suggest. Do not take initiative.
- **dont fix things with bandaids. Create clean codes**
- dont work around issues. solve them
- always use garden ui componoents and widgets to impplement new pages
- use garden ui, not bootstrap
- always use garden ui
- i turned off the cdn for now
