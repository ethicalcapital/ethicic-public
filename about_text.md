** What I do around here** 

I sit in the center of the Ethical Capital Investment Collaborative, and spend most of my time translating insights from our clients, colleagues, and research into our investment strategies.  

That means much more than just picking stocks that go up and avoiding ones that go down. Our process is oriented towards cumulative learning, which means I spend most of my time understanding companies, the communities they serve, and the consequences of their activities.

I also get to spend a lot of time getting to know our clients, which I find profoundly grounding.

** What I did Before This **

I’ve been working in investment management since I graduated from high school.

After spending some time at a regional brokerage firm and a Bangalore-based family office, I joined the staff at the nonprofit CFA Institute while I was still a sophomore in college.

I then spent close to a decade partnering with some of the most interesting investors on the planet to create educational materials aimed at advancing the craft of investment management. In the process, I wrote dozens of articles, edited hundreds, and got to speak to communities of investment professionals all around the world. 

I also realized that mainstream firms were only scratching the surface of what’s possible in sustainable investment management. That observation would eventually lead me to start this firm. 

** Things I've Written ** 

If you want to understand my personal journey, this essay on how I became an active manager is the best place to start.

Besides that, here are a few other pieces I’ve written here:

What Would a Recession Actually Mean for Long-Term Investors?
What Does Inflation Mean to You?
What Should You Expect When You’re Investing?
I’ve also written a textbook on investment idea generation and essays on all sorts of things.

If you want to understand the values that drive my approach to finance, check out Can Financial Advisers Make Their Clients Happy and Finance Shouldn’t Think Small, which I wrote almost ten years ago.


** What I do Besides This ** 

Co-host Free Money with Sloane and Ashby, a darn good podcast. 
Spend as much time as I can justify skiing at one of Utah’s many awesome resorts.
Kill my lawn and replace it with perennial wildflowers and other compelling habitats for wildlife.
Serve as a board member at Responsible Alpha, a consultancy that supports organizations as they transition towards sustainability.
Support my colleagues at the Woodcache Public Benefit Corporation, a carbon removal company I co-founded.

** Book Me As a Speaker ** 

I love public speaking! I’ve given keynote addresses in all sorts of forums and moderated/participated in more panel conversations than I can count. 

Whether you’re looking for someone to talk to novice investors about aligning their money with their values or a crash course on modern sustainable investing, I’d love to participate.
