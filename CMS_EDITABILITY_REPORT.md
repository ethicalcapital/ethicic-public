## Technical Patterns Used

### StreamField Patterns
```python
# For repeating items with multiple fields
services = StreamField([
    ('service', blocks.StructBlock([
        ('title', blocks.CharBlock(max_length=100)),
        ('description', blocks.RichTextBlock()),
    ]))
], blank=True, use_json_field=True)

# For nested categories
resources = StreamField([
    ('category', blocks.StructBlock([
        ('title', blocks.CharBlock(max_length=100)),
        ('items', blocks.ListBlock(blocks.StructBlock([
            ('icon', blocks.CharBlock(max_length=10)),
            ('title', blocks.CharBlock(max_length=100)),
            ('description', blocks.CharBlock(max_length=200)),
            ('url', blocks.URLBlock()),
        ])))
    ]))
], blank=True, use_json_field=True)
```

### Migration Pattern
1. Add fields to model
2. Create migration
3. Create data migration to populate defaults
4. Update template to use model fields
5. Update content_panels for admin UI
