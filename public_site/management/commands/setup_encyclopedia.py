Rather than trying to beat the market through active stock selection, passive managers aim to match market returns while minimizing costs.</p>

                    <h3>Key Principles</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Index Replication:</strong> Holdings mirror those of a chosen benchmark index</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Turnover:</strong> Minimal buying and selling reduces transaction costs</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Lower management fees due to reduced research and trading</li>
                        <li><strong>Market Return:</strong> Accepts market returns rather than attempting to exceed them</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Advantages</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower expenses and fees</li>
                        <li>Broad market diversification</li>
                        <li>Transparency of holdings</li>
                        <li>Tax efficiency due to low turnover</li>
                        <li>Consistent with efficient market theory</li>

                    <h3>Common Vehicles</h3>

The goal is to reduce risk by spreading investments across various asset classes, sectors, and securities that would each react differently to the same economic event.</p>

                    <ul>
