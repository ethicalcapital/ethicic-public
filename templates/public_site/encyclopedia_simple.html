                            Active portfolio management involves the selection of securities based on research. This is meaningfully distinct from Index Funds, which generally are designed based on rules and administered by third-party index providers. A portfolio that employs active portfolio management strategies could outperform or underperform various benchmarks or other strategies. In an effort to meet or surpass these benchmarks, active portfolio management might require more frequent trading or "turnover." This results in shorter holding periods, higher transactional costs and/or taxable events generally borne by the client, thereby potentially reducing or negating certain benefits of active asset management including returns achieved. Ethical Capital's investment strategies are primarily active, though we may use index funds from time to time for tactical reasons or to fulfil client mandates.

                            ADRs, or American Depositary Receipts, are securities designed to simplify the process of investing in foreign securities. They are generally issued through a partnership with a custodian bank, which operates in the United States and issues the ADR, and a depository bank, which holds shares of the underlying company in trust within its country of origin. Though these facilitate access to overseas investments, they also come with associated fees and may not be formally affiliated with the underlying company. We carefully consider the risks and benefits of such investments when designing investment strategies.

                            When investing in securities, such as stocks, there is always a certain level of company or industry-specific risk that is inherent to each company or issuer. These include the risk that the company will perform poorly or have its value reduced based on factors specific to the company or its industry. This is also referred to as unsystematic risk and can be reduced or mitigated through diversification.

                            Most investment firms rely on commercially available software or services to design and implement their investment strategies. Over-reliance on these vendors can lead to risks, as a firm is relying on the accuracy and validity of the information or capabilities provided by selected vendors, rating services, market data, and the issuers themselves. As described in our process, the investment strategies managed by Ethical Capital are primarily based on internal research. This may reduce the risk of receiving incomplete information from third parties, but also comes with the risk that our own research processes will miss key factors, which may lead to worse investment outcomes.

                            Stocks are susceptible to general market fluctuations, which may include volatile increases or decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. If an investor held common stock or common stock equivalents of any given issuer, these instruments may be exposed to greater risk than if the investor held preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer. Preferred stocks can be affected by interest rate and liquidity risks. Also note that preferred stock dividend payments are not guaranteed; some are subject to a call provision, meaning the issuer can redeem its preferred shares on demand, and usually when interest rates have fallen.

                            Our portfolio construction methods are predicated on our ability to make accurate assessments of whether a company's practices are aligned with the ethical principles that we use to determine our investable universe. Such determinations are necessarily based on the use of nonfinancial, nonstandardized, and unstructured data which is prone to gaps in coverage, inconsistent calculation methods, and "greenwashing" by company management. As a result, our techniques, analyses, and assessments may miss material ethical issues, leading the portfolio to temporarily hold securities that are inconsistent with established ethical criteria. We may also inaccurately exclude a security from our investable universe based on these incomplete or inaccurate data, which may lead to overlooking a potentially attractive investment opportunity which would have been permissible under our ethical covenant. Additionally, the composition of an ESG focused portfolio could differ significantly from its index in terms of sector composition, company weightings, and industry exposure. This could cause the portfolio to underperform portfolios that are not constructed with a similar focus.

                            Exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded note risks include risks due to their underlying securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, derivatives, etc.), and can be affected by risks such as market, currency, credit, political, interest rate, etc., that are described in other glossary entry. The liquidity of the underlying stocks in the index can affect their liquidity. Liquidity risk can result from an insufficient number of "active participants" performing their duties as intermediaries and liquidity providers in the market. "Spread risk" may also occur, which is the difference between the bid and the ask price of a security. Since ETF/ETN transactions are priced throughout the day and are traded on the exchanges like stocks, widening spreads may occur and have an impact on certain portfolios or transactions. As with any security, if the ETF/ETN "fails," the investor may lose their gains and invested principal. ETFs and ETNs can carry additional expenses based on their share of operating expenses and certain brokerage fees. Some ETFs and ETNs have the potential to be affected by "active risk;" a deviation from its stated index.

                            Investments in securities of foreign companies (including direct investments as well as investments through ADRs) can be more volatile than investments in U.S. companies. Diplomatic, political, or economic developments, including nationalization or appropriation, could affect investments in foreign companies. Foreign securities markets generally have less trading volume and less liquidity than U.S. markets. In addition, the value of securities denominated in foreign currencies, and of dividends from these securities, can change significantly when foreign currencies strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. Financial statements of foreign issuers are governed by different accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards than the financial statements of U.S. issuers and may be less transparent and uniform than in the United States. Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign issuers than about most U.S. issuers. Transaction costs generally are higher than those in the United States and expenses for custodial arrangements of foreign securities may be somewhat greater than typical expenses for custodial arrangements of similar U.S. securities. Some foreign governments levy withholding taxes against dividend and interest income. Although in some countries a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion will reduce the income received from the securities comprising an account's portfolio.

                            Fundamental analysis involves scrutinizing company filings and financial performance to derive insights about the health of a business and the future prospects of the securities it issues, like stocks and bonds. The challenge involving fundamental analysis is that information obtained may be incorrect; the analysis may not provide an accurate estimate of earnings, which may be the basis for a security's value. If analytical processes are informed by incorrect information, a fundamental analysis may result in unfavorable performance.

                            Gearing ratios are financial ratios that compare some form of owner equity (or capital) to debt, or funds borrowed by a company. "Gearing" is a measurement of the entity's financial leverage, and demonstrates the degree to which a firm's activities are funded by its shareholders' funds versus creditors' funds. The gearing ratio demonstrates the degree to which a firm's operations are funded by equity capital versus debt financing. Gearing ratios have more meaning when they are compared against the gearing ratios of other companies in the same industry.

                            Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. As with other technology companies, information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources, or personnel. In addition to that, the products of information technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates, and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.

Conversely, when trading volume is high, there is also a risk of not being able to purchase a particular issue at the desired price.

                            Macroeconomic risk derives from the behavior of industries and governments and the relationships between them rather than from individual companies. It concerns fiscal and monetary policies, trade and investment flows and political developments on a national and international scale. Business cycles, depressions, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, valuations, prices, and imports/exports volumes are all unpredictable and can lower or destroy the value of investment portfolios. Central banks and governments often resort to inflationary policies and excessive fiat currency issuance through borrowing and printing. These macroeconomic maneuvers may possibly support or increase the nominal value of investment assets short term but can also lead to inflation and asset bubbles and later crashes.

                            Mutual Funds pool investments from many individuals and institutions into a vehicle designed to express a particular strategy. As with ETFs and ETNs, the risk of owning a mutual fund is reflected in the underlying security(ies). Mutual funds are affected by risks such as market, interest rate, currency, credit, political, active risk, etc., as described in other entries in this glossary. It is important to note that even "conservative" funds, such as a money market fund or fixed income fund, can and have lost their value below the principal amount invested. Mutual funds typically carry additional expenses based on their share of operating expenses and trading (brokerage) fees, which may result in the potential duplication of certain fees paid by the investor. Indexed mutual funds can also be adversely affected by "QDI ratios" that are described elsewhere in this glossary. There are essentially nine main types of mutual fund shares classes, as well as sub-classes for some of these. Some open and closed-ended funds are sold through brokerage firms and assess a commission ("load") in addition to their underlying fees earlier noted, while others are offered through investment advisers, retirement plans and other institutions. "No load" funds are also available to the public through brokerage firms, and they usually incur trading (brokerage) fees. If a client chooses to purchase a mutual fund on their own through a broker/dealer, they should consider the trading fees, internal operating costs, as well as potential commissions they pay through that executing firm. Our firm is not a broker/dealer and (as described in our Form ADV) and does not recommend nor is compensated by "loaded" funds.

                            While ETFs/ETNs and mutual funds are known for their potential tax-efficiency and higher "qualified dividend income" (QDI) percentages, there are asset classes within these investment vehicles or holding periods that do not benefit. Shorter holding periods, as well as commodities and currencies (which may be an underlying holding of an ETF, ETN or mutual fund), may be considered "non-qualified" under certain tax code provisions. We consider a holding's QDI when tax-efficiency is an important aspect of the client's portfolio.

                            Events such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters may adversely affect the value of securities issued in those areas. The combination of climate change, political polarization, and deep social inequality could exacerbate these stresses wherever in the world they may occur. This may be further magnified by the nature of global investing, since certain international markets may be substantially more volatile and less liquid than domestic securities. Because registered investment company securities (e.g., a mutual fund) may invest a large portion of their assets in securities located in any one country or region, their performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.

                            Withdrawals from investment accounts may coincide with periods of low or negative investment performance, which can lead to circumstances where clients are forced to sell at inopportune times. We work hard to ensure that our clients are able to weather these periods, and encourage them to reach out if they feel they may need to withdraw funds sooner than expected. Where neccessary, we seek to mitigate this risk by ensuring that a proportion of a clients' account is invested in less volatile securities (like fixed income instruments or money market funds) so that the neccessary funds are less exposed to market volatility.

                            Settlement is the process by which funds and securities are exchanged to invest new capital or withdraw capital from the market. Though infrequent, there is a risk that one party will fail to deliver the terms of an investment contract with another party (contra-party) at the time of settlement. Settlement risk can be a risk associated with default, along with any timing differences in a settlement between the two parties.

                            Our investment strategies may invest in the securities of companies that are generally described as "small cap" or "mid cap." This refers to the outstanding value of their securities, and indicates that the company may have fewer financial resources than larger competitors. Such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established companies. In particular, investments in these small- and mid-sized companies may pose additional risks, including liquidity risk, because these companies tend to have limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and may depend upon a relatively small management group. Small- and mid-cap stocks, therefore, may be more volatile than those of larger companies. These securities may be traded over-the-counter (OTC) or listed on an exchange. With that said, these companies may be involved in innovative businesses which provide unusual impact and the prospect for higher returns. We carefully construct our portfolios to balance the risk of investing in these firms with their potential benefits.

                            Technical analysis is a research discipline which attempts to uncover patterns and project future price movements based on patterns in charts, graphs, and market behavior. The risk of investing based on technical analysis is that they may not consistently predict a future price movement; the current price of a security may reflect all known information. A change in the market price of a security may follow a random pattern and may not be as predictable as desired. This may occur due to analyst bias or misinterpretation, a sector analysis error, late recognition of a trend, etc. We do not predicate investment decisions on technical analysis, but do occasionally use these techniques to manage risk and rebalance our investment portfolios.

                            Warrants are securities that enable the holder to purchase a security at a fixed price (referred to as the exercise price) for a fixed period of time. Generally these are longer-dated than options, and can have volatile values based on current market conditions. This volatilty can be high and operate to an investor's disadvantage. The value of the certificate can drop to zero and, if it happens before it is exercised, the warrant could lose any of its redemption value. In addition, a warrant holder has no voting, shareholder, or dividend rights and therefore has no say in the functioning of the company, even though they are affected by the decisions and policies of that company and its management. We do not generally purchase warrants outright, but have occasionally received them by participating in SPAC transactions or Initial Public Offerings.
