        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ethical investing is an investment approach that considers environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors alongside financial returns. At Ethical Capital, we hand-screen companies to exclude those involved in activities that conflict with your values, such as fossil fuels, weapons manufacturing, tobacco, and companies with poor labor practices. Our goal is to build portfolios where ethics and excellence converge."

Our screening includes fossil fuel involvement, weapons manufacturing, tobacco products, animal welfare practices, human rights records, environmental impact, corporate governance, and labor practices. We use proprietary research tools and databases to ensure comprehensive coverage and up-to-date information."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We offer three primary investment strategies: Growth Strategy (high-conviction portfolios of 15-25 ethically screened companies), Income Strategy (ethical screening applied to income-generating securities with focus on yield), and Diversification Strategy (ethically screened external funds for broader diversification). Each strategy can be customized based on your specific ethical preferences and financial goals."

      "name": "How does ethical investing performance compare to traditional investing?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Research shows that ethical investing can perform as well as or better than traditional investing over the long term. By excluding companies with poor ESG practices, ethical portfolios often avoid major scandals and regulatory issues that can hurt stock performance. Our focus on high-quality companies with strong governance often leads to more stable, long-term returns. However, past performance does not guarantee future results, and all investments carry risk."

      "name": "Can I customize my ethical screening criteria?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely. We understand that ethical preferences are personal and can vary significantly between individuals. While we have standard screening criteria that exclude the most common ethical concerns, we work with each client to customize their portfolio based on their specific values. This might include additional exclusions or different weightings for various ethical factors."
