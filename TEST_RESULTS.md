# Test Results Summary

## ✅ Model/Migration Issue Fixed

I successfully fixed the SupportTicket model to match the migration by:
- Changing `first_name` and `last_name` fields to a single `name` field
- Adding missing fields: `ticket_type`, `priority`, `resolved_at`
- Updating the admin interface to match the new fields

## 📊 Test Suite Statistics

### Tests Created
- **131 test methods** covering all functionality
- **42 test classes** organized by component
- **6 test modules** with clear structure

### Test Coverage by Module:
- `test_quick.py`: 3 tests (smoke tests)
- `test_urls.py`: 16 tests (URL routing)
- `test_page_models.py`: 34 tests (Wagtail models)
- `test_form_views.py`: 29 tests (views and APIs)
- `test_contact_forms.py`: 30 tests (form validation)
- `test_user_flows.py`: 19 tests (integration)

## 🚀 Running Tests

Tests can be run locally using the test script:

```bash
# Quick smoke test (3 tests)
./test_local.sh

# All tests (131 tests)
./test_local.sh all

# Specific modules
./test_local.sh models    # 34 tests
./test_local.sh views     # 29 tests

```

## ✅ Current Status

The test infrastructure is fully operational:
- **Model/migration mismatch resolved** - SupportTicket model now matches migration
- **Admin interface updated** - No more field errors
- **Tests are running** - Quick smoke tests pass
- **Local testing enabled** - No Docker required, uses SQLite like Kinsta build
