## Deployment Metrics Tracking

### Historical Build Times
| Date | Project | Build Duration | Status | Issues |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|--------|
| 2025-08-23 | ethicic-public | TBD | Monitoring | - |

### Current Monitoring Status
- **Deployment Platform**: Kinsta
- **Expected Duration**: 2-5 minutes (typical)
- **Monitoring Interval**: Every 30 seconds during active deployment
- **Critical Components**: Chart.js integration, YouTube embedding, API endpoints
- **Test Readiness**: Pending deployment completion

### Reconnaissance Report - Initial Check (2025-08-23 05:27 UTC)
- **Site Accessibility**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Site loading properly
- **Chart.js Integration**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT DETECTED - No Chart.js library or canvas elements found
- **Performance Pages**: ‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE - Strategy pages loading with data tables
- **YouTube Embedding**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
- **API Endpoints**: üîç PENDING VERIFICATION
- **Status**: Deployment may still be in progress or build failed

### Deployment Activity Detected (2025-08-23 05:30 UTC)
- **CRITICAL INDICATOR**: 503 errors on /insights/ and static files
- **Assessment**: Active deployment or CDN cache clearing in progress
- **Main Site**: Still accessible (likely served from cache)
- **Static Resources**: Returning 503 (deployment rebuilding assets)
- **Recommendation**: Continue monitoring for 2-3 more minutes

### Post-Deployment Assessment (2025-08-23 05:31 UTC)
- **Site Accessibility**: ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL - All main pages accessible
- **Blog Section**: ‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE - /blog/ returning 200, content loading properly
- **Strategy Pages**: ‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE - All strategy pages loading with data tables
- **Chart.js Integration**: ‚ùå NOT DETECTED - No Chart.js library or canvas elements found
- **Navigation**: ‚úÖ IMPROVED - Header navigation spacing improvements visible
- **Static Files**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some 404s on direct static file access (normal for protected assets)

### Critical Finding
The deployment appears to be PARTIALLY successful. The navigation improvements are visible, but the Chart.js integration is not present on strategy pages. This suggests either:
1. Chart.js changes were not included in this deployment
2. Build process failed to include Chart.js assets
3. Chart.js functionality is pending additional configuration

### Final Assessment (2025-08-23 05:33 UTC)
**DEPLOYMENT STATUS**: ‚úÖ STABLE & READY FOR TESTING
**Total Monitoring Duration**: ~6 minutes
**Site Stability**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - All pages loading consistently

#### Deployment Success Matrix:
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Spacing**: Improvements visible and functional
- ‚ùå **Chart.js Integration**: Not detected on strategy pages
- ‚ùì **YouTube Embedding**: Unable to locate test content
- ‚ùì **API Endpoints**: No public API routes accessible
- ‚úÖ **Template Components**: Base functionality working
- ‚úÖ **Site Performance**: All pages loading < 2 seconds

#### Recommendations for Testing:
1. **Immediate Testing Safe**: Core site functionality is stable
2. **Chart.js Investigation**: Check local build or look for console errors
3. **YouTube Embed Testing**: Look for specific blog posts with video content
4. **API Testing**: Test specific endpoints if you know their routes

**SENTINEL STATUS**: Site is operational and ready for your testing phase. Some advanced features may need investigation.

### Error Pattern Analysis
*No previous errors recorded - establishing baseline*

### Performance Indicators to Watch
- Site accessibility (200 status)
- JavaScript console errors
- Chart.js library loading
- YouTube video functionality
- API endpoint responses
- Navigation layout integrity
