Of course, here is the information from the form formatted as neat markdown, with all available choices recorded and the selected options indicated.

# Onboarding

I'm delighted to welcome you to Ethical Capital. Our client relationships are lifelong partnerships, so this form is designed to quicken the "getting to know you" process so we can serve you with loyalty, prudence, and care over the long term.

But to be clear, we want to know you.

That means: be human. You are encouraged to make jokes, share fears, and say "I don't know" without a moment's hesitation.

Thank you in advance for sharing a bit of yourself with us. And welcome!

## Your Values and Viewpoint

At Ethical Capital, we maintain a unified ethical framework that applies consistently across all client portfolios. So this section isn't about creating a customized ethical approach for you specifically. Instead, we're gathering your insights to strengthen our collective standards. Because when one client raises a novel ethical concern, all of us benefit from their perspective.

You'd be surprised how many times clients with no professional background in investing or sustainability have steered us away from danger well before it was obvious. So thank you in advance!

## Your Financial Team

Long-term investing is our sole focus at Ethical Capital. This specialty makes us somewhat akin to a surgeon. We are happy to offer practical guidance about anything we can — and are always interested to know more about our clients' lives — but most of what we do comes down to renovating and reassembling portfolios.

This means over the course of the lifetime we hope to work together, you will have needs we can't fulfill. For instance, you may need:

* A financial planner to build out a detailed budget,
* A money coach to help you get your hands around everything, or
* A finance-informed therapist.

We know those kinds of people, and love working alongside them to support our clients.

* **Is there someone (accountant, attorney, etc) you'd like us to coordinate with?**
    * [No response provided]

* **Would you like us to refer you to a values-aligned professional with one or more of these characteristics?**
    * ✅ Accountant
    * ✅ Attorney
    * ✅ Bookkeeper
    * ✅ Financial planner
    * ✅ Insurance agent
    * ✅ Money Coach
    * ✅ Therapist
    * ☐ Other:

* **Is there anything else going on in your life you'd like to tell us about?**
    * [No response provided]
