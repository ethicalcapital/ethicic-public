# Comprehensive Usability Audit - Ethical Capital Public Site
Date: January 28, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Non-functional hamburger menu appearing at all viewport sizes
- **Solution**: Removed hamburger menu entirely since mobile navigation is always visible
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more consistent navigation experience

### 2. Logo Consistency
- **Problem**: Footer logo styled differently than header logo (missing hover effects and link)
- **Solution**: Standardized both logos to use identical markup and styling
- **Impact**: Consistent branding throughout the site

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
- **Problem**: Navigation items wrapping poorly on medium screens
- **Solution**: 
  - Improved responsive breakpoints
  - Made navigation always visible (no hidden mobile menu)
  - Adjusted font sizes and padding for mobile
  - Hide search on very small screens (< 640px) to prevent cramping

## Current State

### Header
- ETHICAL logo with lavender triple-underline branding
- Navigation items always visible and properly wrapped on mobile
- Search and login buttons appropriately sized
- Clean responsive behavior at all screen sizes

### Footer
- Matching ETHICAL logo with same styling as header
- Both logos are clickable links to homepage
- Consistent hover effects on both

### Mobile Experience
- Navigation items wrap gracefully on smaller screens
- No confusing hamburger menu that doesn't work
- All critical functions accessible at all screen sizes
- Search hidden on very small screens to prioritize navigation

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Mobile Search**: Currently hidden on screens < 640px. Consider adding a search icon that expands to full search on mobile if search is critical.

2. **Navigation Items**: With 5+ navigation items, consider grouping or prioritizing for mobile to prevent excessive wrapping.

3. **Performance**: Multiple responsive breakpoints and CSS rules - monitor performance on older mobile devices.

## Accessibility Maintained
- All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- Skip link functionality preserved
- Focus states properly defined
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on actual mobile devices (not just browser DevTools)
2. Verify all navigation links work on touch devices
3. Test with screen readers to ensure navigation is properly announced
4. Check performance on older mobile devices
