# Accessibility Fixes Implemented - January 28, 2025

Based on the comprehensive accessibility audit of ethicic.com, the following critical issues have been addressed:

## 1. CRITICAL: Fixed Low Contrast Text Issues

### Problem
- Light gray text on white background failed WCAG contrast requirements
- Particularly problematic on Solutions page with descriptive text

### Solution
- Updated `card-ec` component to use `text-gray-700` in light mode (7:1 contrast ratio)
- Maintained `text-gray-300` for dark mode on dark backgrounds
- Fixed all instances of `text-gray-200/300/400` on white backgrounds
- Added proper dark mode support throughout

### Files Changed
- `/static/css/tailwind-base.css` - Updated card component color defaults
- `/templates/public_site/strategy_list_tailwind.html` - Fixed all text contrast issues

## 2. Added Visual Indicators for Interactive Elements

### Problem
- Strategy boxes lacked clear visual indicators of interactivity
- Users couldn't tell elements were clickable until hovering

### Solution
- Added `border-2` for stronger visual presence
- Added `cursor-pointer` for hover indication
- Added `transform hover:scale-105` for visual feedback
- Added `hover:shadow-lg` for depth perception
- Made elements keyboard accessible with `tabindex="0"` and `role="button"`
- Added screen reader hints with `aria-describedby`

## 3. Improved Social Media Link Accessibility

### Problem
- Social media links lacked descriptive context for screen readers
- Generic "LinkedIn" or "Twitter" text didn't indicate whose profile

### Solution
- Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all social links
- Specified "Visit Sloane Ortel's LinkedIn profile" etc.
- Fixed both About page personal links and footer company links
- Maintained visual text while providing better screen reader context

### Files Changed
- `/templates/public_site/about_page.html` - Personal social media links
- `/templates/public_site/base_tailwind.html` - Footer company LinkedIn link

## 4. Image Alt Text Review

### Finding
- Alt text implementation was already properly done across templates
- All images have appropriate alt attributes with fallbacks
- Featured images use title fallbacks appropriately

## Remaining Accessibility Considerations

1. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Manual testing recommended with Tab key navigation
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Remodeling Banner**: Review implementation for screen reader friendliness
4. **Focus States**: Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus indicators

## Testing Recommendations

1. Use automated tools:
   - axe DevTools
   - WAVE (WebAIM)
   - Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)

2. Manual testing:
   - Navigate entire site using only keyboard
   - Test with screen reader software
   - Check color contrast with actual contrast checking tools
   - Test with browser zoom at 200%

3. User testing:
   - Engage users with disabilities for real-world feedback
   - Test with users who rely on assistive technologies

## Compliance Status

With these fixes implemented, the site should now meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for:
- Color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Keyboard accessibility for interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility for navigation elements
- Clear visual indicators for interactive components

The most critical accessibility barrier (low contrast text) has been resolved, significantly improving readability for users with low vision.
